For the quarter that ended May, Wall Street expect Adobe to report $1.54 per share on revenue of $2.16 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 51% and 21.6%, respectively. For the full year, ending November, earnings are expected to rise 50% year over year to $6.46 per share, while full-year revenue of $8.84 billion would climb 21% year over year.
The company’s strong cloud execution, particularly in its Marketing Cloud segment where it competes with the likes of Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce (CRM), has been nothing short of remarkable. Driven by large Marketing Cloud customers such as Verizon (VZ), UPS (UPS) and Pandora (P), among others, Adobe’s decision to focus on high-potential segments like enterprise services has paid significant dividends.
Elsewhere, the company’s Creative Cloud segments is witnessing better-than-expected subscription adoption among government and educational institutions. Still, for the shares to continue their strong momentum run, the San Jose, Calif.-based software giant on Thursday must deliver a top- and bottom-line beat, while issuing confident guidance.
Beyond the headline numbers, analysts will look for strength in gross margins, which should assuage concerns about the stock’s valuation. Wall Street will also focus on the company’s subscription growth as a sign of predictable revenue. Currently, some 90% of total revenues are now subscription-based. While that number might be tougher to grow, any sign of erosion may spook investors.
Finally, as of last quarter, the company had an impressive $4.3 billion in net cash, thanks to its surging cash flow rate (reached $1 billion in Q1). Can that figure continue to climb? And will management deploy that cash towards M&A or towards rewarding shareholders with a dividend — something analysts would love to see?
Despite the company’s solid cash, earnings and revenue position, bears are often quick to point out Adobe’s valuation, which has surpassed those of its software peers. Indeed, the stock, which has risen 47% year to date, including 8% over the past month, currently trades at 40 times fiscal 2018 estimates of $6.46 per share, which is more than twice the average stock in the S&P 500 Index.
At the same time, as I pointed out above, Adobe’s estimate of $6.46 per share calls for 50% year-over-year growth. Not many S&P 500 stocks are growing revenue at that rate, much less profits. And from my vantage point, given the company’s strong fundamentals, combined with its consistent execution, it would be a mistake to part with this winner today.

It's been quite the roller coaster for Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU ) stock of late. A long bull run driven by strengthening pricing in DRAM and NAND sent the stock above $60 for the first time in 18 years back in March. Within weeks, MU stock was near $45.
A quick rally followed to a new multiyear high, only for more choppiness to follow the past few sessions. An analyst downgrade, concerns about a regulatory investigation in China, and continuing pricing concerns all have added to the volatility in Micron stock.
I'd expect that volatility to continue for the foreseeable future. Micron is one of the most cyclical stocks in the market, and clearly, some investors are getting nervous. A sub-6x forward P/E multiple seems ridiculous in the context of recent growth, but given the huge swings in pricing, and profits, Micron has seen in the past, it makes some sense.
Micron should look cheap on an earnings basis, particularly at this point in the cycle. But that aside, MU stock still is too cheap, as I've argued several times in the past. The question for bullish investors is whether they want to ride out the volatility - or try to take advantage of it.
Bad News Follows Good News
The new late May high near $65 for MU stock appeared well deserved. The stock had slumped coming out of fiscal Q2 earnings in March, despite a solid beat and strong guidance for Q3.
20 Long-Term Value Stocks With Hulking Upside
As the calendar turned to May, however, pricing in both NAND and DRAM appeared strong. Analysts got behind the stock, with RBC Capital projecting nearly 50% upside . And as I wrote last month, the company's Analyst Day provided more good news, notably with even better guidance for Q3 and a $10-billion share repurchase authorization .
But a week later, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) would downgrade MU stock, sending it tumbling. The cut was largely a valuation call, as James Brumley pointed out, but analyst Joseph Moore also raised concerns about pricing and demand . Two days later, reports of a Chinese investigation into DRAM price-fixing added more pressure.
And so the tug-of-war over MU stock continues. Bulls tend to look at current results and the seemingly insanely low valuation. Bears are looking for the inevitable crash around the corner. Micron stock seems stuck in the middle.
Stick With MU Stock
For now, Micron stock seems worth hanging on to. Again, the stock isn't as cheap as earnings multiples suggest. Cyclical concerns are real. The Chinese investigation could lead to lower DRAM prices in that market.
Micron, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) and SK Hynix could make voluntary concessions along the way. NAND maker Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: WDC ) has instituted a buyback of its own, though WDC's recent weakness could portend trouble for Micron in that offering.
Still, demand looks solid across the chip space. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and even Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) all continue to rally. In memory, demand should stay strong, particularly given an increasing diversification away from the flat or declining PC business.
And again, MU stock is cheap. The current earnings multiple already incorporates some level of pricing weakness going forward. It's not as if the stock is trading at 15x earnings, and bears are arguing that profits are going to decline. Most bulls, too, accept that the cycle will turn at some point. The argument comes down to when, and how big that turn proves to be.
Profiting From Volatility
Meanwhile, some of the volatility could offer a better entry point for investors to build or add to their positions in MU. Chris Tyler detailed a bullish option spread on the stock last week. And investors - particularly those with big gains - can use options to protect their capital.
Indeed, far out-of-the-money puts still look rather cheap. The Jan 2019 $30 put, for instance, is offered at just $0.13.
That's a premium of less than a quarter of a percentage point of the current price, offering protection against what admittedly would be a nearly unprecedented crash in MU stock. But note that MU did fall more than 50% in the first seven months of 2015. When the cycle turns in memory, it can turn violently.
There Still Is Plenty Upside Left for Micron Technology, Inc. Stock
All told, a straight bet on Micron stock still looks profitable. But the caution I advised back in March is worth having again at these levels. Long term, MU stock still has upside. In the near term, the road may be bumpy indeed.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE ) reported earnings last night and investors are selling the stock on the headline. Management beat bottom-line expectations, but only met revenue expectations, albeit at record levels. I like that the recurring revenues continue to grow. This provides a consistent stream of revenues upon which they can continue to plan for bigger and better things.
Today's Wall Street wants to see the wow-factor and usually that comes from forward guidance. ADBE management only guided inline revenues so that perhaps contributed to the reaction of disappointment. This is a relative term these days made worse because we just had new all time highs in the NASDAQ, where we see massive moves on frothy momentum tickers.
So odds are that this dip is exaggerated by the money flow out of something that is sound and solid like ADBE to chase the frothy tickers. Luckily, I have recent profits from being long momos like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ), so I will roll some of the risk into a fundamental bet into ADBE's 2018 prospects.
Add to it a sprinkle of ADBE operating imperfections with regards to margin and you get yourself a run-of-the-mill dip after a long run. Is the rally over? Hardly! To that, the ADBE CFO said that they expect their momentum to continue. Usually CFOs are not overtly confident so this is a testament that the upward trend shall continue through 2018.
7 Strong Buy Stocks Analysts Are Upgrading Now, Including Facebook, Inc.
Today's dip is painful to those newer longs, but ADBE is a stock that came into the report up 85% in a year and 45% in 2018 alone. So a small retracement is necessary to maintain the overall trend.
Dips in Adobe stock are rare and shallow. So they don't appear like obvious long entry opportunities. That is why I use options to generate my profits without needing upside momentum. Today I sell downside risk against what others fear today. I am confident that proven support in the stock will hold, especially that management still has a large buyback program to help my cause.
ADBE stock is not cheap since it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 64. This is three times that of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and twice that of Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ). And this is another reason why using options makes more sense then buying the shares outright with no room for error. In options, I can dig a large moat around my risk in case the selling persists.
I don't need a rally to profit. If proven support holds through 2018, then I retain my maximum potential profit. Otherwise, I own ADBE shares but at a deep discount from current price.
Technically, ADBE has several pivot levels that should provide support on the way down. The first is at $240-per-share, then the next three are $10 apart from that. Each of these should be reliable, but not bullet-proof given the slant of the wedge. If they break, they can overshoot on the way down. So I will hide my risk behind all of them.
The Trade: Sell the ADBE OCT $200 put for $2.50. Here I have an 85% theoretical chance of success. Otherwise and if price falls below it, then I would suffer losses below $197.50.
Those who want to mitigate the risk that comes with selling naked puts can sell spreads instead.
The Alternate Trade: Sell the ADBE OCT $200/$205 bull put spread, which has about the same odds of winning and would yield 15% on risk. Compare this with risking $250-per-share here and without any room for error and expecting a rally profit.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) shares were declining throughout regular trading hours Monday as the company received a downgrade from an analyst over mounting competition.
Source: Shutterstock
Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard downgraded the stock in a note to investors from market perform to underperform due to CPU competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) and other companies developing similar products.
""Intel's process technology leadership is diminished if not evaporated,"" wrote Richard. He added that he expects AMD's 7-nanometer server CPU and 14-nanometer notebook CPU offer great competition to Intel's own products.
This prediction is due to the fact that other companies have been more successful at decreasing the size of their chips in terms of nanometers in order to make them cheaper and more powerful. Intel has a 10-nanometer process that is ""roughly"" equivalent to the 7-nanometer product that competitor Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: TSM ), which has AMD as a customer.
Plus, Intel's 10-nanometer technology has been delayed multiple times, prompting its management to recently say that the product won't be in production until some time in 2019, which could allow other companies to get ahead of Intel.
""We expect that AMD will sample a 7-nanometer server CPU in 2H:18 and move into production in 2019 likely in lockstep or slightly ahead of Intel,"" Richard wrote. ""We also expect AMD's 14nm notebook CPU to ramp in 2H:18, diminishing Intel lead in this category and driving AMD share gains.""
INTC stock fell about 3.4% on Monday following the downgrade.

Although able to rally off the morning lows, U.S. equities were under pressure Friday on renewed concerns over a potential trade war with China. Early Monday, stock market futures are down across the board with the Dow Jones Industrial Average set to open 212 points lower. On that note, here are our top stock trades going into this week before the bell Monday.
Top Stock Trades for Monday: Adobe (ADBE)
On Thursday after the close, Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE ) beat on earnings and revenue expectations . Despite another quarter of solid results, shares took a dip on Friday, likely on account of its 40% year-to-date rally.
10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever
The trend has been pretty obvious from the lower left to the upper right. In that sense, it's a lot likeSalesforce.com, inc. (NASDAQ: CRM ). The 50-day serves as a pretty good proxy for ADBE. A retest-and-hold of this level would give bulls the green light to add to or initiate a new position in Adobe.
Top Stock Trades for Monday: Canada Goose (GOOS)
Canada Goose Holdings Inc (NYSE: GOOS ) isn't getting down on trade woes. Instead, shares are rocketing by more than 30% Friday after the company's strong earnings result .
GOOS has been in a solid uptrend for the last 10 months and long-term investors are really celebrating after Friday's big move. However, new investors would be wise to wait for a pullback or consolidation if they're interested in GOOS.
With an RSI of 90 (green circle), now's not a good time to get in. It could go higher, surely, but the odds don't favor a great risk/reward at this point. Let's wait on this one.
Top Stock Trades for Monday: Silver (SLV)
Silver looked like it was ready to go, teasing bulls with a breakout earlier this week. Instead, the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: SLV ) dove on Friday and is nearing a critical support level near $15.25.
Should this level fail, retests of recent lows near $14.80 and $14.50 are on the table. For bulls, it offers an attractive risk/reward to buy near $15.25. If SLV fails, they can bail with minimal losses.
Although I'll admit, there's not much else that enticing about the metal right now. I'd rather buy a breakout over downtrend resistance than buy into support with the hope that it holds. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ) was also weak on Friday and presents a similar scenario.
Top Stock Trades for Monday: Sogou (SOGO)
The Chinese internet stocks have been on fire . The ones we've been watching are Huya Inc - (ADR) (NYSE: HUYA ), iQiyi, Inc (NASDAQ: IQ ), Sogou Inc (NYSE: SOGO ).
Focusing on the last one specifically, SOGO performed well on Friday, up more than 5% and outperforming some its peers after lagging for a few sessions. Shares went on to make new highs on Friday, but could not stay above $14.50.
So where to from here? Luckily, SOGO trades with easy-to-identify levels. $10, $11, $12, $13, etc. They've all played a role in the stock's trading patterns. $13 is significant to me though. It's the IPO price and if SOGO falls through $14, this become a must-hold level for bulls.
Granted, $12 could be support and so too could $11. But $13 being the IPO price would be a meaningful level for shares to find support. Let's see if it does, if SOGO even falls that far. If so, it'd be a tempting buy.
Top Stock Trades for Monday: Roku (ROKU)
Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU ) is one that we nailed about a week ago . On a breakout over $40, we were looking for a run to $45 and if momentum kept up, possibly a test of $50.
Well, we hit $45 on Thursday and saw ROKU slip on Friday. Now what? Because ROKU has been doing so well lately, I would love to jump back in on a pullback into the low-$40s, perhaps near $42.50.
5 Things to Expect in the Second Half of 2018
However, if stocks really come under pressure, Roku could slip down to $40. Should it hold, it's a must-buy for bulls.

The question lingering in investors' minds is whether or not this memory chip maker will be able to continue its impressive performance in the quarter.
Notably, Micron has delivered positive earnings surprises for 10 straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 8%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.
As long as memory chip prices and demand continue to rise, Micron is likely to keep benefiting. The ongoing investigation by the Chinese government on allegations that Micron, along with Samsung and SK Hynix, indulged in fixing memory prices, is unlikely to conclude any time soon. This lowers the possibility of any negative impact on demand and prices in the near term.
What the Zacks Model Unveils?
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Micron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP , and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Micron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 but has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
However, the stock is likely to register massive year-over-year growth on both the counts, i.e. revenues and earnings per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter's earnings is pegged at $3.14, which is 93.8% higher than the year-ago quarter's reported earnings of $1.62. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.70 billion, up 38.3% from the prior-year quarter tally.
Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote
Let's see what's driving this overwhelming expectation.
DRAMs to Continue Driving Revenues
Micron has been the key beneficiary of the upswing in DRAM prices and strong demand which was triggered in the second half of calendar-year 2016. DRAM, which is one of Micron's biggest revenue contributing segment (71% of 2Q18 revenues), is likely to deliver better numbers, given a supply shortage and increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at datacenters. This should further drive demand for DRAMs. Notably, AI-enabled servers require five to six times the capacity of regular DRAMs compared to standard cloud servers.
Going ahead, rising demand for DRAMs from autonomous vehicle manufacturers is expected to have aided the company's to-be-reported quarterly results. Self-driving vehicles need to make real-time decisions by analyzing large amounts of data, which necessitates the use of high-performance DRAMs.
Declining NAND Prices to Partially Mute Top-Line Growth
In the last fiscal, the company witnessed impressive growth in NAND revenues due to the massive demand-supply gap which escalated chip prices. Nonetheless, we expect this segment's growth rate to have remained moderate in the fiscal third quarter as the supply-demand gap has narrowed down significantly, according to various research firms, which is affecting chip prices adversely.
Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, Micron witnessed a low-double-digit rise in bit shipments, while average selling price (ASP) declined in the mid-teens range. Therefore, looking at the current scenario, we believe decline in ASP will have negatively impacted the company's NAND revenues and margins, and somewhat offset the benefits from improved demand and prices for DRAM products.
Some Stocks With Favorable Combinations
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:
Seagate Technology Plc STX has an Earnings ESP of +0.77% and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1.
Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR has an Earnings ESP of +3.54% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.
eBay Inc. EBAY has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and holds a Zacks Rank of 3.
Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies
It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Begun the trade wars have. U.S. stock futures are careening lower this morning. President Donald Trump threatened $400 billion in more tariffs on China yesterday.
President Trump reportedly asked U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer to identify $200 billion more in Chinese products to target for 10% tariffs and threatened to find $200 billion more if China retaliated. China's Ministry of Commerce said the country would take comprehensive measures in response.
The quick escalation in rhetoric has Dow Jones Industrial Average futures plunging 1.38% this morning. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures have dropped 1.01% and Nasdaq-100 futures are down 1.25%.
In options activity, volume was anemic on Monday. Only about 17.7 million calls and 13.1 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume plunged to 0.54. The 10-day moving average, meanwhile, held at 0.54 - its lowest point since January.
Options traders took aim at the semiconductor industry yesterday. Analysts at Cowen praised Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) while Northland Capital Markets downgraded Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ). Both cited AMD's rising market presence. Elsewhere, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) options volume spiked after CEO Elon Musk once again took aim at short sellers.
Let's take a closer look:
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)
AMD hit a fresh 52-week high on Monday after Cowen lifted its target on the shares to $21 from $18. The ratings firm cited cloud computing opportunities based on AMD's coming 7 nanometer (nm) chipset.
3 Subscription Service Stocks With Huge Long-Term Growth Potential
The new Radeon Vega GPU and second generation Ryzen Threadripper are both expected to feature 7nm tech and arrive months ahead of Intel's 10nm competitor chips.
""Along with recent announcements of new server deals with Cisco CSCO/Tencent TCEHY and the crystallization of our 7nm AMD versus 10nm Intel thesis, we are increasingly confident in upside to AMD shares,"" Cowen said in a note to clients .
AMD options traders cheered the news as well, piling into call options. Volume surged to 470,000 contracts, with calls making up 67% of the day's take.
However, most short-term AMD options traders are calling for a reversal. Specifically, the July put/call open interest ratio has ballooned to a reading of 1.49, with puts easily outnumbering calls among front-month options. With AMD trading deep in overbought territory, these options bears may be onto something.
Intel Corporation (INTC)
Along the same lines, Northland Capital Markets said that ""Intel's process technology leadership is diminished if not evaporated."" The ratings firm downgraded INTC stock to ""underperform"" from ""outperform"" citing AMD's coming 7nm and 14nm processor lines.
Specifically, these lower-powered chips would finally allow AMD to pose significant competition to Intel in the notebook PC market - one in which AMD has yet to make serious headway.
INTC stock options traders rushed to take profits following the downgrade. Volume rose to 179,000 contracts, with calls making up 60% of the day's take. Profit taking among Intel options traders was evident as its July put/call OI ratio rose to 0.83 from a reading below 0.80 late last week.
Tesla Inc (TSLA)
Tesla CEO Elon Musk once again took aim at short sellers over the weekend. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that short sellers ""have about three weeks before their short position explodes."" In about three weeks, Tesla is expected to provide a production update on the Model 3, with many analysts believing the company will finally hit its production goal of 5,000 vehicles a week.
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Stock Is Astounding, But Don't Be Left Holding the Bag
TSLA options traders were surprisingly call heavy for a change. Volume rose to 328,000 contracts on Monday, with calls snapping up 63% of the day's take - well above the norm for the typically dour TSLA options backdrop.
Speaking of ""typically dour,"" Tesla's July put/call OI ratio comes in at 1.20, indicating that short-term traders remain largely bearish on the shares. Don't expect this to change with the current trade war fears swirling around, but if Tesla hit's its production targets in three week's, Musk's prediction could well come true.
As of this writing, Joseph Hargett held no positions on any of the aforementioned securities.

We note that, on an average, the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.17% in the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, Red Hat delivered positive earnings surprise of 13.75%.
Earnings jumped 49.2% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion.
Revenues increased 22.8% year over year to almost $772.3 million, primarily on the back of strong demand for hybrid cloud solutions as well as aggressive cross-selling. The figure was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $762 million.
Buoyed by solid results, Red Hat stock has returned 46.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 16.7% rally in the industry it belongs to.
Strong Partner Base & Acquisitions to Drive Growth
We believe that Red Hat's strong partner base that includes the likes of IBM, Intel, Dell Technologies, Google cloud platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") will continue to drive growth.
The partnerships are helping Red Hat to cross-sell cloud-based technology across its customer base. Management expects the expanding partner base to drive 80% of new bookings in the near term.
Additionally, complementary acquisitions have led to a favorable product mix, which is, in turn, bolstering overall results.
The company's strategy of making acquisitions (CoreOS, Permabit, Codenvy, 3scale, Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank, Codenvy) that can be easily integrated into current business has expanded its product portfolio into higher-growth segments, such as Hybrid cloud and other emerging technologies (Cloud Management, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Storage).
OpenShift continues to gain traction, which is a key catalyst for the soon-to-be reported quarter. Another driving force for the quarter is Red Hat's dominance in containerized application development.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Red Hat expects revenues between $800 million and $810 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 68 cents per share.
What Our Model Says?
According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.
Red Hat has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which indicates an unlikely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell, before they're reported, with our Earnings ESP Filter .

U.S. stock futures are headed higher this morning. Wall Street is digesting yesterday's trade-war induced plunge, with bargain hunters picking through the fallout. The situation remains precarious, however, with President Donald Trump calling for $200 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports, and China promising to retaliate in kind.
Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones are up 0.39%. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures have risen 0.21% and Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.26%.
In options activity, volume remained well below average despite the market's plunge. Overall, about 17.1 million calls and 15.8 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume rose to 0.59. The 10-day moving average ticked higher to 0.55.
Options traders gave new tech a go and old tech the boot on Tuesday. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) call options volume spiked after the stock saw a pair of price target increases.
7 Small-Cap Stocks to Consider for the Second Half of 2018
Meanwhile, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) was flooded with puts after news broke it was being kicked out of the Dow. Finally, Snap (NYSE: SNAP ) was popular among call traders despite a bearish note from Cowen on user data.
Let's take a closer look:
Netflix (NFLX)
Both GBH Insights and Piper Jaffray lifted their price targets on NFLX stock yesterday. Piper bumped Netflix to $460 from $375 due to a solid second-quarter outlook. GBH was a super bull, however. The rating firm lifted NFLX stock to $500 from $400 and said that there was an ""an eye-popping disparity"" between Netflix's user engagement and its closest rivals.
NFLX stock hit an all-time high following the pair of bullish notes, despite a steep market selloff. Options traders chased the rally. Volume on NFLX rose to 328,000 contracts, or nearly double the stock's daily average. Calls made up 63% of the day's take.
Despite the bump in bullish sentiment, there is plenty of room on the Netflix bandwagon. For instance, the July put/call open interest ratio rests at a lofty reading of 0.99. This ratio is falling quickly, though, after hitting a high near 1.21 less than two weeks ago.
General Electric (GE)
It's the end of the old guard for the Dow. General Electric Company, the last of the original Dow 30, is being shown the door. GE will be replaced by Walgreens (NYSE: WBA ).
GE stock fell 1.8% on the news and was down another 1.3% in premarket trading this morning. Options traders, used to chasing GE stock lower, loaded up on put options yesterday. Volume topped 308,000 contracts, with puts claiming 67% of the day's total activity.
A closer look reveals that the July $12.50 put was the most popular. According to Trade-Alert.com , more than a third of yesterday's total volume traded at the July $12.50 put on GE. What's more, most of those (including a block of 85,000 contracts) traded at the ask price.
Snap Inc. (SNAP)
Snap stock plunged more than 5% yesterday after analysts at Cowen took aim at the shares . The rating firm cut its price target to $9 from $10, and lowered its daily active user outlook as well as its earnings and revenue estimates for fiscal 2018.
""Per our recent ad buyer survey, SNAP was lowest [sic] Social platform in key attributes like ROI, data and user targeting,"" Cowen told clients in a research note.
But SNAP options traders appeared more interested in a rebound. Volume rose to 203,000 contracts, with call making up 62% of the day's take. The July put/call OI ratio also edged lower, slipping from 0.95 to 0.93 overnight.
Traders that got into Monday's bear put spread recommendation on SNAP could have hit their maximum return yesterday … if they were nimble. SNAP hit an intraday low below $13. The stock is headed back to $13 in premarket trading this morning, so keep your eyes on your positions.

However, they can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over, so it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their businesses.
One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is Adobe Systems IncorporatedADBE . This firm, which is in the Computer - Software industry, saw EPS growth of 43.2% last year, and is looking great for this year too.
In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 53.6%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 16.2%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul.
Adobe Systems Incorporated Price and Consensus
Adobe Systems Incorporated Price and Consensus | Adobe Systems Incorporated Quote
And if this wasn't enough, the stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 3.6%. Thanks to this rise in earnings estimates, ADBE has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which further underscores the potential for outperformance in this company. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here .
So, if you are looking for a fast-growing stock that is still seeing plenty of opportunities on the horizon, make sure to consider ADBE. Not only does it have double-digit earnings growth prospects, but its impressive Zacks Rank suggests that analysts believe better days are ahead for ADBE as well.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.
It's not the one you think.

Brian Krzanich was ousted as chief executive of chip-making giant Intel (INTC) following an investigation into a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee,"" the company said Thursday.
Intel shares are down 2.3%, to $52.24, in trading today.
""An ongoing investigation by internal and external counsel has confirmed a violation of Intel's non-fraternization policy, which applies to all managers,"" Intel said in a statement. ""Given the expectation that all employees will respect Intel's values and adhere to the company's code of conduct, the Board has accepted Mr. Krzanich's resignation.""
Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan has taken over as interim CEO while the company's board searches for a permanent replacement immediately, the company said. Krzanich also left Intel's board.
Intel on Thursday also raised guidance for its second fiscal quarter to adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share on revenue of $16.9 billion. The Silicon Valley company previously forecast Q2 earnings of 85 cents a share on $16.3 billion in revenue.
Yet the departure of Krzanich, 58, concerns Mizuho semiconductors analyst Vijay Rakesh, who cites Krzanich's ""strong manufacturing background"" and a ""gap at the top."" Intel also faces intensifying competition from Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Still, Rakesh maintains a ""Buy"" on Intel shares and a $60 price target.
Intel shares soared 120% during Krzanich's five-year tenure as CEO.
BK, as Krzanich is nicknamed inside Intel, joined the company in 1982 and cut his teeth in engineering. The guts of a product - not the prestige of his title - is what motivates him. ""We work out a story line where we give people a view of the future"" that is also practical in their lives, Krzanich said in a 2015 interview with this reporter.
It was during the same interview that Krzanich vowed to increase the diversity of Intel's U.S. workforce by 2020. The company pledged $300 million to fund the hiring and retention of women and underrepresented minorities, the largest investment in diversity then by a technology company.

A recent article in Forbes notes that this year, beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is replacing its system of periodic manual store shelf audits with technology from Singapore-headquartered retail analytics start-up Trax. The time-consuming manual audit system, in which field representatives physically visit stores and count bottles, can take months to return valuable information on retail inventory movement and competitor product placements.
Trax uses image recognition technology, combined with analytics and artificial intelligence, to obtain the basic data of a shelf audit while providing more comprehensive insights. Shelf images uploaded to Trax's cloud servers are analyzed by what the company terms its ""advanced computer vision algorithms,"" and a monthly analytic dashboard is provided to clients. The software also provides insights into store trends within the packaged goods products that surround beverage aisles.
According to Trax's website , it offers these services under two primary products, Shelf Pulse and Shelf Intelligence Suite. Both are enhanced with additional insights provided by global measurement specialist Nielsen Holdings and privately held consumer goods sales and marketing agency Acosta.
Tools of the type produced by Trax will help companies like Coke obtain a much faster and more complete picture of the grocery, convenience store, and club shopping channels. According to Forbes , Coca-Cola will now be able to increase the frequency of its corporate-initiated marketplace data survey, from twice a year to six times annually.
Relevance to Coca-Cola strategy
As the world's largest beverage company has shifted its business model away from manufacturing and toward marketing, it's embarked on a widely watched journey of portfolio diversification. Most shareholders are aware of these sea changes in the company's business model.
However, as I discussed earlier this year , Coca-Cola is also employing three distinct tactics in the near term to improve earnings growth. First, it's leaning toward pricing power versus selling on brute volume to improve the quality of its sales. Second, the organization is ""lifting and shifting"" brands between continents to spur the rate of innovation. Finally, Coca-Cola continues to roll out low-sugar variants in its sparkling beverages portfolio to meet consumer demand.
Visual intelligence can assist with each of these strategies. Coca-Cola can piece together a more complete view of competitor pricing as it adjusts its price-volume mix. It can also achieve a better understanding of local brands as it seeks to transfer winning beverages from one geographical region to another. And management can get a quicker read on how a sugar-free offering like Coke Zero, for instance, is faring as it extends across new markets.
Of course, much of this data in the future will be analyzed by the company's bottlers as much as it will by Coca-Cola, as bottlers ultimately are responsible for shelf distribution. According to Forbes , the beverage giant is already testing Trax with a handful of its North American bottling partners, and my guess is that Coke's global bottlers will also adopt the technology soon.
For beverage companies, getting software like Trax in the hands of bottling distributors is almost as important as management's own use of it. Take Coca-Cola investee Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) , for example. As I wrote in May, the energy drink specialist is building on its long-term potential by methodically expanding via Coca-Cola bottlers around the globe .
In some geographical regions, Monster is working with bottlers to create an energy drink shelf where one doesn't already exist. On the company's most recent earnings conference call, Chief Operating Officer Hilton Schlosberg provided the example of the China market:
Monster investors may be focused on near-term issues clouding insight into the company's margin , but you can see how over the long run, creating an energy drink category on convenience shelves in China could help create exceptional value.
Monster and its Coca-Cola bottling partners could use visual shelf technology to better understand which local brands it needs to displace to create this category in a mammoth market like China. They could also gain a view into which Chinese beverages actually complement Monster sales on the shelf, thus influencing ongoing product placement. Most importantly, Monster could theoretically get much faster data than is currently possible, on which of its innumerable energy brands is enjoying the most traction with Chinese consumers.
Of course, there's one obvious drawback to such shiny digital tools as Trax provides. As an industry increasingly adopts the next generation of technology, any single company's advantage in using the software gets negated. But for now, replacing the slow manual process of obtaining shelf insight with an analytics-rich dashboard should serve early adopters well in the never-ending battle for product real estate.

Trade War Fears Strike Back
Markets have been gripped by trade war fears for quite some time. Fears further escalated this week after President Donald Trump threatened to slap additional 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth in Chinese goods. Consequently, China too said that it will take retaliatory measures. This saw stocks tumbling, which continued on Thursday, as investors panicked leading to huge selloffs.
Supreme Court Makes it Difficult for Online Retailers
On Thursday, the Supreme Court in a ruling said that states could collect sales tax from online retailers, who do not have physical presence in their states. Till the ruling, retailers were required to collect sales tax only if they had a physical presence in a state. This gave e-commerce companies the advantage of not collecting sales tax thus making the product cheaper. This resulted in states making huge losses in revenues.
The new ruling now enables states to force online retailers to pay sales tax. This saw shares of online retailers like Amazon, E-Bay and Etsy, Inc. ETSY taking a hit, while shares of brick-and-mortal stores like Walmart WMT , Target TGT and Dollar General DG jumping.

Trade War Fears Strike Back
Markets have been gripped by trade war fears for quite some time. Fears further escalated this week after President Donald Trump threatened to slap additional 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth in Chinese goods. Consequently, China too said that it will take retaliatory measures. This saw stocks tumbling, which continued on Thursday, as investors panicked leading to huge selloffs.
Supreme Court Makes it Difficult for Online Retailers
On Thursday, the Supreme Court in a ruling said that states could collect sales tax from online retailers, who do not have physical presence in their states. Till the ruling, retailers were required to collect sales tax only if they had a physical presence in a state. This gave e-commerce companies the advantage of not collecting sales tax thus making the product cheaper. This resulted in states making huge losses in revenues.
The new ruling now enables states to force online retailers to pay sales tax. This saw shares of online retailers like Amazon, E-Bay and Etsy, Inc. ETSY taking a hit, while shares of brick-and-mortal stores like Walmart WMT , Target TGT and Dollar General DG jumping.

With that said, June could end up being the busiest month for IPOs in a long time, and this week is packed once again.
Recent IPOs
Spotify stock closed its first day of trading in early April at a price that valued the company at $26.5 billion, which helped it land as the eighth-largest tech IPO after one day of trading, directly behind Google and GOOGL and Snap SNAP . Aside from Spotify and Dropbox, Docusign Inc DOCU and Smartsheet SMAR were a few other notable 2018 tech IPOs.
Meanwhile, many investors have been looking forward to IPOs from Uber and Airbnb. But those industry-changing tech companies look poised to wait until at least 2019 to go public-although Uber rival Lyft could reportedly go public in late 2018.
Since the start of June, 22 companies have gone public, with 12 more expected to IPO this week. In fact, if all the planned initial public offerings are completed this week, it would be the busiest IPO month since June 2015, according to Renaissance Capital. So let's take a look at a few of the bigger IPOs expected this week and quickly break down what the companies do.
BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) - Deal Size: $600 million Exchange: NYSE
BJ's Wholesale is a membership-based grocery chain that operates over 200 stores across the East Coast, competing against the likes of Costco COST . The company was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital Partners Ltd in 2011 for roughly $2.8 billion.
BJ's Wholesale reported annual sales of $12.75 billion last year and turned in a profit of $50.3 million. The company is set to go public amid changing times for the grocery industry. Yet, the talk of doom and gloom seems to have calmed down for the time being since Target TGT , Walmart WMT , and Kroger KR have all proven their ability to fight back against likes of Amazon AMZN (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks, WMT, COST, TGT, After Kroger's Strong Quarter? ).
The company's IPO is expected to be priced between $15 per share and $17 per share, offering 37.5 million shares. Bank of America Merrill Lynch BAC is one of the lead underwriters.
BrightView Holdings (BV) - Deal Size: $501 million Exchange: NYSE
BrightView is a Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania-based commercial landscaping design and maintenance services company, which operates mostly in the U.S. BrightView works in an array of fields, including water management, golf, sports turf, snow and ice removal, and many more.
Goldman Sachs GS is the lead underwriter for the company that plans to list 21.3 million shares at between estimated $22 per share and $25 per share.
Domo (DOMO) Deal Size: $189 million Exchange: Nasdaq
Domo (DOMO) is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs this week, mostly because of its one-time standing as a unicorn company-a private startup valued at over billion dollars. However, its valuation has plummeted 75% from its last funding round. Domo noted that the middle of its IPO pricing is expected to be $20.50 per share.
Domo is a company that investors might want to pay close attention to over the first couple of months as its real-time business data analytics software competes against the likes IBM IBM , Microsoft MSFT , and Oracle ORCL . The Utah-based company's clients include Mastercard MA and eBay EBAY .
The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All
Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

A report by the Wall Street Journal suggesting that the U.S. is planning even stricter trade measures on China sent names like Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Micron (MU) tumbling on Monday. The latter lost as much as 8% at its low, resulting in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index losing 3% Monday.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said that the Treasury Department is crafting rules that will restrict any Chinese firm with a stake of 25% or more from acquiring any U.S.-based company deemed by the Federal government as having “industrially significant technology.” The terms and length of the restriction are still being sorted through. And we won’t know what they are until an official announcement is made at the end of this week.
""The president has made clear his desire to protect American technology,"" said Wilbur Ross, Commerce Secretary, according to the Journal on Sunday. ""All possibilities that would better protect American technology, including potential changes to export controls, are under review.""
That’s all well and good, but there’s nothing new here. Trade tensions between the two countries have been escalating to the point where such a measure — assuming the WSJ is correct — became predictable. Not to mention, President Trump campaigned on this exact premise, promising to protect intellectual property of U.S. companies. So, from my vantage point, the drop in tech stocks, particularly chip companies with tons of momentum, is an overreaction.
Meanwhile, the selling hysteria also reached the FAANGs — referring to Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL) where they collectively fell by an average of 3%. Investors who decided to take profits and/or rotated out of chip and techs are ignoring the fact that all of these tech giants still have strong fundamentals. Collectively, they’re projected to grow 2018 earnings by an average of 81% — well above 15% projected growth rate of the S&P 500 index.
All told, despite the so-called “headline risk,” the fact remains that corporate revenue and earnings are on the rise. And when compared to the rest of the S&P 500 Index, tech stocks — despite their consistent stock outperformance — are arguably still the cheapest names on the market by virtue of their projected earnings growth rate.

For the Invesco S&P 500 Pure Growth ETF (Symbol: RPG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $125.86 per unit.
With RPG trading at a recent price near $114.68 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.74% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RPG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Aptiv PLC (Symbol: APTV), SVB Financial Group (Symbol: SIVB), and Adobe Systems Inc (Symbol: ADBE). Although APTV has traded at a recent price of $95.12/share, the average analyst target is 11.06% higher at $105.64/share. Similarly, SIVB has 11.01% upside from the recent share price of $302.16 if the average analyst target price of $335.44/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADBE to reach a target price of $265.11/share, which is 10.61% above the recent price of $239.68. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of APTV, SIVB, and ADBE:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) has been on an absolute tear from its April lows. It's been almost three months since we saw those lows, where AMD stock was basing around $9.50 per share.
Luckily, we were buyers around $10 . In any regard, AMD has been marching in a straight line higher, rallying from its lows near $9 to its highs near $17.50. The stock almost hit a double and I think with time, it will.
However, some are calling for dramatically higher upside. So far in June, AMD stock has felt the love from analysts. It has an $18 price target from Wells Fargo and a $20 target from Merrill Lynch and Baird. Just rallying to $20 from current levels represents 30% upside.
But there's also a $21 price target from Cowen and a whopping $27 price target from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann. The latter target represents more than 75% upside from current levels and would make AMD nearly a triple from its April lows.
Can it get there?
Valuing AMD Stock
I never understood the criticism that AMD received. Were shares overvalued because they ran from $2 to the teens? Perhaps at that very moment based on current or past results. But not based on the future, which is what matters to investors.
In reality, AMD and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) were thriving on a secular wave of graphic chip demand. For the most part, the two companies still are, while Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) is benefiting from strong chip demand too.
4 Developments That Will Fuel the Mega Marijuana Market
With rising demand comes a spike in revenue, which we had (and again) still have with AMD. The company worked its way from losses, to the black and now to profitability. It tidied up its balance sheet and showed Wall Street it's ready to play ball.
Are its products as good as Nvidia or its balance sheet as strong as Intel? No, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a buy.
For some time now, we've advocated for owning all three - INTC, AMD and NVDA. It diversifies the risk and still gives us exposure to a great secular theme.
For what it's worth, AMD stock now trades at 25 times next year's earnings. That's more than Intel's 12.5 times earnings, but less than Nvidia's 31 times. On a sales basis, AMD trades at 2.23 times 2018 revenue, cheaper than both Intel and Nvidia at 3.4 and 11.2 times, respectively.
Investors have to evaluate stocks in a relative manner. What stands out above? That AMD stock isn't as expensive as some may have thought. What else? That NVDA trades at more than 11 times sales. That's crazy at first glance, but look at the bottom line. It trades at a reasonable earnings valuation and its net margins of ~34.5% are double that of Intel's.
Trading AMD Stock
After a run from $9 to $17, AMD stock generally falls into the ""no touch"" pile for investors. However, this name should be on investors' radar as a buy-the-dip candidate.
AMD stock was simply overbought earlier this month when it hit its highs. Don't get me wrong, it was great to see it take out its previous highs near $15.50, where it failed twice before. But it was definitely due for a rest. In some respects, it still is.
I don't think $14.50 is a bad place for longer term investors to load back up. Admittedly, buying near this level is easier if they were long from sub-$10 and already booked 50%+ gains in just a few months. But this would be my first level to consider repurchasing AMD. My next and more preferred? $13.50-ish.
5 All-Star Dividend Stocks for Any Portfolio
Should AMD stock fall to this level and find it as support, it will deal a great level of confidence to bulls. That would be the backside of downtrend resistance, a mark that held Advanced Micro in check for more than a year. If it's now support, it will signal a big bullish change in AMD's technical setup.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In trading on Wednesday, shares of eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.5, after changing hands as low as $36.29 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) is 37.9. A bullish investor could look at EBAY's 28.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of EBAY shares:
Looking at the chart above, EBAY's low point in its 52 week range is $33.945 per share, with $46.99 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $36.30.

(Symbol: AMD) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 10th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMD options chain for the new August 10th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $15.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.07. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $15.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $13.93 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $15.12/share today.
Because the $15.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.13% return on the cash commitment, or 60.55% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $15.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $15.50 strike price has a current bid of 94 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of AMD stock at the current price level of $15.12/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $15.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.73% if the stock gets called away at the August 10th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AMD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AMD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $15.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $15.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.22% boost of extra return to the investor, or 52.77% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 84%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 79%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $15.12) to be 47%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies
It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Todays' volume has tracked the high-side of the bid-ask spread, indicaiteing that these new calls were likely bought to open.
InvestorsKeyhole Trade Alert
IK-> The technicals for EBAY ($36.84 up $0.17) are bearish with a possible trend reversal. The stock has support around 35.20. Look at the Aug. 31/33 bull-put spread for a 20-cent credit. That's a 11.1% return and the stock has to fall by 10.4% to cause a problem. [InvestorsKeyhole, various news and data services]

Dr Pepper Snapple (NYSE: DPS ) has become unusual among its peers for one reason - growth. In an environment where consumers increasingly avoid sugary beverages, DPS stock has maintained a growth trajectory.
Now, the company begins anew as Keurig Dr Pepper beginning on Jul. 10. This will leave many wondering how the merger will affect the Dr Pepper Snapple growth story. Still, with the merger priced into DPS stock, investors should probably temper their expectations.
DPS Stock Has Performed Better Than Its peers
To be sure, the beverage industry faces challenges. With all the consciousness about health and the warnings related to both sugar and sugar substitutes, consumers increasingly avoid these drinks.
Moreover, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) has little room to expand. PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP ) has suffered years of declining revenues and profits. So, the only company in this category that outperforms DPS is Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST ). However, with its energy drinks, one could argue it exists in a class by itself.
Now, these companies will compete with the new Keurig Dr. Pepper, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""KDP."" This will become the third-largest nonalcoholic beverage company in the country. It will also stand as the seventh-largest company in the food and beverage industry.
10 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in July
With its larger size and orientation less focused on soft drinks, the new KDP stock should stand out as the stock of choice in the nonalcoholic beverage industry. However, this does not mean investors should buy into this industry or KDP stock.
Performance Expectations Have Remained Muted
Back in March, our own Luke Lango said that the market should value DPS stock at between $120 and $130 per share. Mr. Lango appears to have made the correct call. Today, DPS trades at about $122 per share.
Even then, he described Dr Pepper Snapple as an ""unexciting investment opportunity."" Most of this year's growth in DPS stock came in January when DPS announced that it would merge with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.
It remains unclear whether DPS stock becoming KDP stock will make the company any more exciting. DPS's five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 20.34. At its current price and estimated net income, the stock trades at about 23.75 times forward earnings.
Investors Will Weigh Options After DPS Stock Special Dividend
However, this P/E may not remain meaningful under the new KDP stock, especially since owners of DPS stock will hold a relatively small share of the new company. Those who hold DPS stock will receive 13% of the company, with Keurig shareholders getting the remaining 87%. Holders of DPS stock will also receive a special dividend of $103.75 per share.
Such a payout will leave many investors with fresh cash in need of investment. Many choices exist. Given the uncertainty surrounding the new company and the lackluster numbers coming from the beverage industry, both dividend recipients and new investors should probably look at different investment options.
Final Thoughts on DPS Stock
With post-merger uncertainty and the struggles of the beverage industry in general, investors should not expect huge gains to come from this merger. DPS stock has become one of the better performers in a slow-growth industry. However, with the new KDP, investors have little information to act on other than a vague expectation for growth.
The new KDP stock could go on to outperform its peers. Still, with beverage companies battling to achieve any growth at all, surpassing industry averages will not necessarily translate into high growth.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. Stock: Take the Merger Premium and Run
Current DPS stock investors will now receive $103.75 in cash for every share owned. Until we know more about the culture, sales and performance of the new Keurig Dr Pepper, dividend recipients should probably invest their cash elsewhere.

The S&P500 is about 50 basis points higher on Thursday, with renewed optimism that the current trade talks will not escalate into a full-blown trade war. That rally highlights several top stock trades as we near the end of this holiday-shortened trading week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Advanced Micro (AMD)
When stocks were showing a larger sign of selling off, we had the $13.50 level on watch for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ).
That would have brought AMD stock to the backside of downtrend resistance. If it held up as support, it would represent an excellent buying opportunity. The problem is, as that trend-line continues to fall as downtrend lines tend to do, our buy trigger falls lower and lower.
10 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in July
If AMD stock is truly in demand, it may no longer be a realistic target. Instead, $14.50 is emerging as a viable candidate. This level was resistance all through 2017 and only just recently began acting as support in June.
Now about 90 cents away, conservative bulls can wait for a pullback and buy near this level. Aggressive bulls can sell cash-secured puts, perhaps the $15s, and if exercised the premium collected will put their cost basis close to this level.
Below $14.50 and perhaps that downtrend line is in the cards after all.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Alphabet (GOOGL)
Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) continues to consolidate in the perfect zone.
After breaking through downtrend resistance, shares continue to find support just above this level. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages are both nearby too, which should provide some extra support should GOOGL and the Nasdaq experience some selling pressure.
For now, KISS - keep it simple. Above former trend-line resistance is bullish while below is not.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Netflix (NFLX)
Speaking of consolidating, look at the excellent price action of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ).
Some investors may not like the recent action or complain that it is stalled. But keep in mind that Netflix stock is up more than 100% so far in 2018! It needs to consolidate some of these moves and this is very healthy price action.
Shares are gearing up for another big move, that much is clear. The only thing we need to figure out is which direction. If the past is any indication, that direction will be higher.
Watch for a move up to $405 to $410. Should we get it, it could spur a rally back to its previous highs near $420 and possibly even new all-time highs above that.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Ventas (VTR)
InvestorPlace readers haven't missed out on the rally inVentas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR ) and a number of other REITs. The group hasn't been held back by the rise in interest rates and continues to surge higher.
However, VTR could be running into some resistance. If I was long from say $50, I might be content to stay long this high-quality company and collect a big dividend.
I wouldn't be a new buyer today, though.
The RSI of 77 shows that VTR is overbought (blue circle) and $58 to $59 could act as resistance. A pullback into the $54 to $55 area should be bought, as there should be multiple levels to support VTR.
$53 should also hold up, both as a support level and near the backside of previous downtrend resistance (blue line).
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #5: Take-Two (TTWO)
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc (NASDAQ: TTWO ) continues to trade well, like its video game peers Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATVI ) and Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ: EA ).
7 Megatrend Stocks With Long-Term Upside Potential
Like GOOGL stock, remember to KISS. Trend-line support (blue line) continues to hold up. Resistance near $117.50 to $120 has held strong since November. It's slowly but surely pushing above this mark. Should it breakout, its prior highs near $130 are the first target.

(Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the August 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new August 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $36.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.21. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $36.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.79 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $36.64/share today.
Because the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.36% return on the cash commitment, or 24.54% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $36.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.43. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $36.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $37.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.89% if the stock gets called away at the August 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $37.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.

Shares of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) gained 12% in June of 2018, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . The surge rested on an impressive presentation at the energy-drink veteran's annual shareholder meeting.
So what
At the meeting, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said that the company's sales growth should float above the 10% mark throughout 2018. In addition, Monster is ready to fight rising ingredient costs by passing the expenses on to consumers in the form of higher prices per can of taurine-infused beverages.
Analysts followed up on these information nuggets with two distinct rounds of bullish research notes, driving share prices more than 5% higher on two consecutive days in early June.
Now what
The stock now is trading some 23% above the 52-week lows that were set in May, based on an uninspiring earnings performance. Analysts and investors have forgiven Monster for these stumbles and are looking forward to a healthier bottom line as those promised price increases come around in the second half of 2018. There's not much to complain about in this company's long-term growth trends.

Now the question for investors is should they consider buying NVDA stock now, ahead of any official GeForce announcement.
GeForce
Brand new reports surfaced on Thursday that suggested that Nvidia is stockpiling roughly one million GeForce GTX 11s in order to meet the demand for a Q3 or Q4 2018 launch. ""It has been two years since the Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10 Series landed, so there is pent-up demand for this family's successor to fuel the 4K gaming craze,"" Hot Hardware 's Brandon Hill wrote.
A new GeForce line would help create even more demand for Nvidia's widely popular graphics cards that help fuel the video gaming industry. The success of the company's GeForce GTX 11 line will be hugely important for Nvidia because, despite the growth of its other segments, its Gaming division is still by far the company's biggest revenue generator (also read: Nvidia Stock Gains as Rumors of Gaming GPU Launch Heat Up ).
Last quarter, Nvidia's Gaming revenues skyrocketed 68% to hit $1.72 billion, accounting for roughly 54% of the company's $3.21 billion in total Q1 revenues. Investors will also be pleased to note that Nvidia's Datacenter revenue soared 71% to $701 million, while Automotive revenues climbed by just 4% to $145 million.
Stock Price Movement
Nvidia's massive year-over-year revenue growth is what has driven shares of NVDA up so high over the last few years. In fact, Nvidia has seen its stock price climb roughly 1,100% over the last three years, which destroys the S&P 500's 31% growth, as well as Amazon's AMZN 290% climb and Netflix's NFLX 321% surge.
Investors will note that over the last two years Nvidia stock has continued to skyrocket. With that said, shares of fellow semiconductor powerhouse Micron MU have outpaced Nvidia over the last year, up 75% compared to NVDA's 69% climb. It is also worth pointing out that NVDA stock currently sits roughly 10% below its 52-week high.
Valuation
Nvidia's impressive run hasn't stretched the company's valuation picture as much as some might assume. NVDA is trading at 33.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates at the moment, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry's 11.2X average-this industry includes the likes of Intel INTC , Advanced Micro Devices AMD , and Texas Instruments TXN .
Diving a little deeper, Nvidia stock has traded as high as 57.4X over the last year, with a one-year median of 44X. NVDA is currently trading just above its year-long low of 32.9X. Therefore, investors should be able to say with some confidence that Nvidia stock is hardly expensive and it might even appear relatively attractive at its current level.
Growth Outlook
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Nvidia second-quarter revenues to climb by roughly 39% to hit $3.11 billion. For the full-year, Nvidia's revenues are expected to surge nearly 36% to touch $13.18 billion.
Moving on, Nvidia looks as though it is set to post much bigger profits this year, with its adjusted Q2 earnings expected to expand by over 81% to touch $1.83 per share. Meanwhile, its full-year ESP figure is projected to reach $7.93 per share, which would mark a 61% surge.
Bottom Line
Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks and sports an ""A"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. NVDA has also earned 11 upward earnings estimate revisions for Q2, against zero downward changes, all within the last 60 days. More importantly, during this same timeframe, Nvidia has received 12 earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside, for both its current fiscal year as well as the following year.
Nvidia's solid forward P/E, top and bottom line growth projections, and its positive earnings estimate revision activity, coupled with what could be a major product launch all signal that now might be a great time to buy NVDA.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

In fact, both the companies are trying to put their best foot forward in a bid to gain further traction in this prospective market. Both the companies are employing aggressive retail strategies, expanding seller base and distribution strength to get an edge over the other.
However, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, has put a spanner in the works with his plans of developing an e-commerce platform by combining Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm, in a bid to bolster the presence of Reliance in the market.
This initiative of Ambani is likely to pose serious threat to the dominant players as well as the other e-commerce giants which are yet to establish themselves namely Alibaba BABA and eBay EBAY .
Further, the platform will be based on online-to-offline (O2O) marketing program, which will aid in attracting customers online and allowing them to shop via offline channels. Consequently, the hybrid model bodes well for the interests of domestic brick-and-mortar stores as these will get a platform to showcase their products online, bolstering their sales numbers.
Additionally, this is likely to benefit the traditional Indian buyers who account for a significant share in the total Indian population and are hesitant to shop online due to issues regarding product quality.
India Holds Promise
Per the latest data from eMarketer, the sales figure in the e-commerce market of India is expected to reach $72 billion by 2022 from $32.7 billion in 2018.
The country is currently witnessing a digital explosion on the back of increasing penetration of smartphone and Internet. Notably, this trend was aided significantly by the initiatives of Reliance Jio.
According to the report from India Brand Equity Foundation, online shopping in the country is expected to reach $135.8 billion in 2018, surging 31% on a year-over-year basis.
Consequently, India remains a strong market for e-commerce businesses and a lucrative one for foreign and domestic investors alike.
Reliance Entry Intensifies Competition
We believe the entry of Reliance in the Indian e-commerce space will intensify the competition, which is likely to impact the shares of Amazon and Flipkart.
Amazon's market share came in 44% as of April 2018, consequently maintaining its dominant position. Meanwhile, Flipkart accounted for 40% of the market share. Further, the monthly active users (MAU) of Amazon grew 40% while Flipkart witnessed growth of 30%.
Additionally, per the recent Citi Research report, Amazon is well poised to reap benefits from this growing market. The company is anticipated to generate more than $10 billion in revenues and nearly $1.5 billion of free cash flow by growing 23% annually till 2027.
Additionally, Amazon India is currently valued at $16 billion while Flipkart is valued at $20-$22 billion due to the Walmart WMT deal.
We note that these growth prospects are likely to suffer due to the growing number of potential entrants into the market.

E-Commerce Investments to Get Hurt
Indian e-commerce space's invitation to Reliance does not bode well for the increasing investments of global retail and e-commerce giants in this market.
The retail giant Walmart has recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire majority stake of 77% in Flipkart for $16 billion. This marks as one of the world's largest e-commerce deals.
Additionally, Alibaba has invested $200 million in India's Paytm Mall which is similar to its TMall. It has also invested in online ticketing platform, TicketNew. Further, it is planning to invest $250-$300 million in online grocer, Bigbasket and its payments affiliate Ant Financial has agreed to invest in food-ordering app Zomato.
Further, eBay has recently announced its plans to relaunch its Indian division, eBay India by selling its stake in Flipkart to Walmart. eBay India aims to start cross-border trade in India via its online platform which will benefit both Indian sellers and buyers.
Nevertheless, Amazon India has issued paid up capital of $2.7 billion toward Amazon Seller Services, its marketplace arm. Moreover, Amazon has almost 41 warehouses in India, a captive logistics unit and operates a payments arm. Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
Consequently, the growing number of potential entrants into the market will continue to intensify the competition. Further, the entry of Reliance might impact the returns on the above mentioned stocks.

The trading action in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) ahead of its quarterly earnings report is almost predictable. If the stock rallies ahead of results, the market ""priced in"" any of the good news in the share price. Any small miss or light forecast will send the stock lower. Conversely, if AMD stock does not trade higher in the weeks before quarterly results, it has a chance of rallying on any mildly good news.
10 Best Stocks Under $10
So, when AMD reports quarterly earnings later this month, how will the stock move this time?
AMD already announced its new product release in the short-term. GlobalFoundries is moving its manufacturing to 7 nanometer, while Intel struggles with its 10nm process. It is of little surprise that AMD will continue to grow its market share in the competitive desktop computing space. As Advanced Micro Devices and its partners roll out Ryzen for mobile, consumers will have more confidence choosing AMD over Intel. AMD offers better pricing for the performance offered, compared to Intel. But for now, Intel still has an advantage with a bigger marketing budget and established brand and more retail channels.
EPYC Sales to Accelerate, Lifting AMD Stock
Advanced Micro Devices announced many partners offering EPYC-powered solutions. These include Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Dell Computers and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE: HPE ). HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ ) will power its DL325 Gen 10 servers with EPYC processors.
AMD does not need that much ambition in growing its data center market share. If it grows its market share to 10% in the next 2-3 years, this would bring in $1.8 billion in revenue annually. That is because the TAM (total addressable market) of the data center market is approximately $18 billion.
Progress with Polaris, Vega GPU
With no big refresh coming from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) with its line of GPUs, AMD could re-ignite sales in this space. Rumors swirled in April that the company may release mobile RX 500X and 560X series Polaris cards for laptops. On July 10, AMD announced a new series of graphics cards, dubbed ""Polaris 30"" .
The timing of the Polaris 30 launch could not be better. Previously, consumers could not even get a Polaris card because cryptocurrency miners would bid for them at up to triple the retail price. Now that the bubble in bitcoin is popping, AMD may start selling this new Polaris variant to its loyal fan base.
This GPU refresh has a number of updates. The chip is manufactured under the 12nm process, leading to better performance and lower power consumption. Enthusiasts will enjoy a performance increase of around 20% with these cards.
Looking ahead, Advanced Micro Devices is set to launch the ""Navi"" architecture to target the mid-range market. This can only help AMD stock.
Valuation
Advanced Micro Devices' valuation is admittedly stretched at a 26.8 forward price-to-earnings multiple, yet AMD stock is still cheaper than that of NVIDIA's, whose forward P/E multiple is 32. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) is still the better investment option for income investors or for value investors seeking a greater margin of safety. Intel stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of just 12.6, while shareholders earn a dividend yielding 2.3%.
On Finbox.io, the Dividend Discount: Multi-Stage model suggests that Intel's fair value is $60. Since AMD's stock does not pay a dividend, investors may use a 5-year DCF Revenue Exit model which would value the company at around $18 a share.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
The heightening volatility in stock markets, combined with AMD's pre-earnings rally, suggests another post-earnings selloff is in the cards.
7 S&P 500 Stocks With Low P/E Ratios
Yet, due to the strong fundamentals of AMD, any big dip in the stock creates an entry point for investors who missed out on the 60% year-to-date gains.

The equity markets are still hostage to headlines mostly about global tariff wars. President Donald Trump is trying to ameliorate the U.S. situation with its economic deals especially with China so he is upping the ante on imposing tariffs. The end result is to hammer out a deal, but until then, investors remain nervous and uncommitted.
Last night and after a positive day for stocks near all-time highs, the U.S. announced a fresh list of tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China. Traders hit the sell buttons overnight so investing in equities these days is affected in the short-term by these headlines.
However, there are few stocks that should be immune to this and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) is one of them. This is a successful global company that is not in the direct line of fire of these trade wars. So in theory, in these dips lie opportunities.
The short-term whipsaw of prices makes trading tricky because it makes entry timing crucial. To circumvent that, I use options where I can go long eBay, but with plenty of room for error.
7 S&P 500 Stocks With Low P/E Ratios
It is important to note that EBAY has other special circumstances. Just before the stock market correction on Feb. 2, EBAY had just spiked to $47-per-share on an earnings report, but that marked a sharp top. Since then it has corrected over 20%, so technically it's in bear market territory.
When a momentum stock falls this fast, it always seems like it's headed into an abyss. Using options makes it easier to catch the falling knife while leaving a buffer between the current price and my level of risk.
While the headline threats still linger this year, I am more comfortable betting that the downside support will hold more so than to expect the upside potential to materialize. Meaning I sell downside risk against what others fear in eBay stock to create income out of thin air.
How to Trade eBay Stock Today
Today's trade setup does not need a rally to profit. In fact, EBAY can fall another 15% and I would still retain maximum gains. Time does the heavy lifting as premiums decay in my favor. If a rally comes, then my profits will materialize faster.
Technically there is risk in the EBAY chart. If it loses the $35-per-share pivotal zone, it can lose another $2 from there. Worst case scenario in this trade setup is that I own eBay shares at a steep discount on the current price. This is an outcome with which I am comfortable as I'm confident that I can manage out of my position over the long-term for a profit.
Fundamentally, EBAY is not cheap from a price-to-earnings ratio, but it's not bloated either. Most analysts on Wall Street agree as it's now trading well below their lowest expectations.
The Trade: Sell the EBAY Oct $33 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 65 cents to open. I have a 80% certainty that I will retain maximum gains. But if the price falls below my strike, then I own EBAY shares. I would then need to manage off my breakeven point of $32.35.
Selling naked puts is daunting, so those who want to mitigate that risk can sell spreads instead.
The Alternate Trade: Sell the EBAY Oct $33/$31 bull put spread, where I have the same odds of winning. Then the spread would yield 16% on risk.

U.S. equities put together a good bounce on Thursday, shaking off some of its losses from Wednesday. Of course, some of the bigger moves caught our eye for our top stock trades.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Broadcom (AVGO)
Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO ) shares plunged on Thursday, falling more than 17% at one point . That follows an almost-3% loss on Wednesday and comes after the company confirmed it would acquire CA, Inc. (NASDAQ: CA ) for almost $19 billion. So what now?
The 20 Stocks From Goldman Sachs' Buy List That You Should Actually Consider
Shares basically cratered through all sorts of support levels, the largest being $220. If I were short, I wouldn't stay that way if shares get back above this mark.
The next ""big"" level of support sits all the way down at $170, although given Broadcom's business, I wouldn't expect it to fall that far. I think we need to let AVGO shake out a bit before the technicals point us in a specific direction.
Over $200 is a start.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: iQiyi (IQ)
This is one that InvestorPlace readers should have nailed, given that we laid out the game-plan for iQiyi, Inc (NASDAQ: IQ ) a while ago. ""The Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) of China"" is one we want to own.
That's why we were buyers into the upper $20s, where Fibonacci support was likely to come into play. Admittedly though, I would have loved for a shot a bit lower at the 50-day moving average. Not only was the 68.2% Fib bounce in the cards, but this was a previous consolidation zone for IQ, which is up almost 10% Thursday. So where to now?
This $35.50 to $36 area could give IQ some trouble, but should it clear it, the $46 highs are technically back on the table. Market sentiment and investor psychology will drive IQ.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Papa John's (PZZA)
While the news about Papa John's Int'l, Inc. (NASDAQ: PZZA ) and its founder is pathetic , the business will likely be fine over time.
But we're not here for a fundamental snapshot, we're looking at the stock price. Right now, PZZA's stock looks nauseating.
$50 looks like it could be a bottoming area for PZZA, but bulls shouldn't think about buying this name until it gets over resistance. While above the 50-day right now, the 200-day and 100-day moving averages still loom over PZZA. There's also tough downtrend resistance overhead near $59.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Applied Opto (AAOI)
In trading, the keep-it-simple (KISS) method tends to work best. Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ: AAOI ) fits that mold.
Is $50 not the most obvious level in the world here? Shares continues to trend higher and a breakout over $50 appears imminent.
Bulls can buy on a close over $50 and use a stop loss below trend-line support. Additionally, should AAOI pullback before breaking out, bulls can buy near trend-line support for solid risk/reward setup.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #5: Adobe (ADBE)
One more KISS setup? Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE ).
Repeat after me : We. Buy. Secular. Winners. On. The. Dips.
Be it a name like Adobe, Salesforce.com, inc. (NASDAQ: CRM ) or any other stock that just keeps on winning , we don't bet the house looking for a loss. It might pullback during market tantrums or like in Adobe's latest case, on quarterly earnings even though the results were great.
Just look at that 50-day moving average, a constant buoy for a higher stock price. If investors buy those corrections enough times, they don't have to worry about the time it eventually fails to hold, given how large their gains will be. And assuming they use some discipline.
7 S&P 500 Stocks With Low P/E Ratios
Now ADBE is knocking on $255's door. Should this level give way - which was resistance last month - the all-time highs near $260 are back on the table. Shares aren't overbought according to the RSI (red circle) and momentum just shifted into the bulls' favor (blue circle).
It's hard to be bearish on ADBE right now.

(Symbol: AMD) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 31st expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMD options chain for the new August 31st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $16.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.21. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $16.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $15.29 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $16.66/share today.
Because the $16.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.33% return on the cash commitment, or 53.53% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $16.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $17.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.18. If an investor was to purchase shares of AMD stock at the current price level of $16.66/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $17.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.12% if the stock gets called away at the August 31st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AMD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AMD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $17.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $17.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.08% boost of extra return to the investor, or 51.70% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 60%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $16.66) to be 46%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Naturally, much like millions of shoppers, the e-commerce giant too will be waiting with bated breath for the shopping extravaganza to start. After all, Prime Day means a lot to Amazon. However, it's not only Amazon that makes a lot from Prime Day. Amazon in a way is also helping its rivals like Walmart Inc. WMT , Target Corporation TGT , eBay, Inc. EBAY and Macy's, Inc. M to cash in on this opportunity.
From brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce companies, Amazon's rivals are trying to make the most of Prime Day with a host of offers. Amazon, which has changed the entire retail landscape in the last few years, is once again proving to be a big influencer in driving retail sales.
Amazon Shows the Way
Launched in 2015, Prime Day has proved to be Amazon's biggest money churning machine. And the e-commerce giant isn't leaving any stone unturned to reach out to more shoppers this time too. In doing so, it has extended Prime Day to a 36-hour online deal, including offers at Whole Foods, expansion to four new countries and surprise events in five cities.
Understandably, extending Prime Day by six hours is in a move to attract more customers. This certainly will boost Amazon's sales, as Prime members will have the option to choose form as much as one million items this time.
The company expects Prime Day to generate $3.4 billion in sales worldwide compared with $2.4 billion in 2017. In fact, so successful was Prime Day last year that it even outpaced Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
Amazon had started Prime Day as a bulk clearance sale but its success turned it into a global shopping event. This certainly has changed the way people have so long shopped. Today, shoppers eagerly wait for Prime Day.
Prime Day Helps Amazon's Rivals
Amazon has changed the entire retail ballgame in the last few years. This has made its rivals change focus toward online retail. Prime Day, on the other hand, has emerged as one of the most attractive shopping extravaganzas in its event calendar. However, in turning Prime Day into a mega shopping affair, Amazon in a way is helping its rivals.
From brick-and-mortar giants to e-commerce companies, today everyone is offering discounts around Prime Day. One of the major beneficiaries is Amazon's closest rival Walmart, which is offering its new customers a discount of $10 on about three different orders using the code, ""WALMART3"" on pickups of $50 or higher till Jul 31. Moreover, Walmart will also be giving 3% cash back to credit card holders for any grocery pickup service from its stores.
Also, Target has entered into a partnership with membership-based grocery service provider, Shipt, for same-day delivery. Similarly, eBay too will be coming up with a wide range of deals starting Jul 16.
It goes without saying that Amazon's rivals are fast trying to catch up. Prime Day has certainly proved to be one of the biggest events for Amazon. So has it for the likes of Walmart, Target and eBay, which are trying to lure more customers with similar deals and discounts. Moreover, Amazon's competitors also have a certain advantage, as Prime Day can be enjoyed only by Prime members, while most of its rivals are keeping their offers open to everyone.
The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All
Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Apple, which is reportedly planning to replace Intel's chips used in Mac computers with its own from 2020 has used the Intel's 8th-generation processors in the device. This will make the 15-inch model up to 70% faster.
Moreover, the addition of the voice assistant ""Hey Siri"" is expected to increase its attractiveness.
Reportedly, the 15-inch model has been priced at a staggering $6,699. However, the pricing of the 15-inch and 13-inch base model has remained unchanged at $2,399 and$1,799, respectively.
Position in the PC market
Apple's focus to strengthen the features of its Mac offerings will help it gain better market share, in our view. The iPhone-maker is currently not a major player in the traditional PC market.
Per IDC's latest report, Apple's ""traditional PC unit market share"" has declined from 7.1% in second-quarter 2017 to 6.9% second-quarter 2018. Moreover, it lags HP, Lenovo and Dell, which have market share of 23.1%, 22.1% and 18.1%, respectively.
We note that in the last reported quarter, Apple Mac unit sales declined 3% year over year to 4.08 million.
Nevertheless, Mac revenues (9.6%) of $5.85 billion remained nearly flat year over year. Latin America, India, Middle East and Africa Central and Eastern Europe showed impressive growth. Globally, active install base of Macs increased in double-digits on a year-over-year basis.

Going by the record customer loyalty that Apple takes pride in, the high sticker price of the revamped MacBook Pros may not pose to be a challenge at all.
However, it now remains to be seen whether MacBook Pro's new upgrades can boost sales amid the socio-economic and competitive challenges that Apple is dealing with.

From a broad standpoint, the story at Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) is pretty simple. The business is hugely attractive. But CRM stock looks overvalued.
7 Hot Stocks Savvy Investors Are Buying
Obviously, there's much more to it than that. But that general split - great business, questionable valuation - seems prevalent across the market. Many of those stocks have provided outstanding returns, including CRM stock, which has risen 247% in the past five years and 63% just in the past twelve months.
Indeed, many investors have the same perception of the entire market. The news is good between tax reform, GDP growth and low unemployment. But as bears have argued for some time, market-wide valuation numbers look awfully high - and potentially unsustainable.
CRM stock seems like the epitome of those market-wide concerns. How an investor views the stock at the moment likely comes down to her view of those concerns - and her strategy for reacting. And how CRM stock will perform going forward likely comes down to just what multiples investors are willing to pay - and for how long.
An Attractive Business Model
Salesforce.com itself has a fantastic business model. It is the premier CRM (customer relationship management) software provider. It popularized the SaaS model which is now being used across the software space.
Salesforce displaced existing CRM leaders SAP (NYSE: SAP ) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ). It has a huge market share lead on tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ).
Looking forward, users are extremely ""sticky,"" with switching costs high. And there's plenty of room for growth, with Salesforce revenue increasing 27% in its most recent quarter .
All told, there are few businesses in the market that seem more desirable than that of Salesforce.com. Competition probably is the biggest concern here, with SAP in particular taking aim with its cloud strategy. The addressable market may shrink over time , as Larry Ramer has pointed out. Still, Salesforce is the unquestioned leader in the space (with little reason to suggest that will change any time soon). And it's an attractive business in which to be.
CRM Stock Valuation
Of course, it's not as if the market isn't paying attention. CRM's market cap now has cleared $100 billion - and valuation metrics look stretched. CRM stock trades at 64 times the high end of its fiscal year 2019 earnings-per-share guidance. P rice-to-free cash flow multi ples are more reasonable, but still dear, at 40. And much of that free cash flow (over half the FY18 figure, in fact) is coming from deferred revenue builds that will slow in importance over time.
Even that 64x figure is based on non-GAAP figures - which exclude stock-based compensation. Salesforce's own guidance suggests that excluding that expense provides a $1.66 per share benefit - more than two-thirds of guided earnings. Backing that out (and it's not free; dilution matters), the P/E ratio is over 200.
However you look at CRM stock, it's pretty obvious that the company is exceedingly highly valued on an earnings basis. And while that alone isn't necessarily a reason to sell, this also is a company heading into its 20th year. And for a mature company, Salesforce.com looks awfully expensive.
What Should (or Will) Investors Do?
The dilemma here isn't uncommon in this market. Investors are comfortable paying big multiples for growth. Few, if any, investors believe that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is going to be a declining business. The question is whether it's worth $400-plus per share.
ADBE looks awfully similar, with big multiples, even better returns of late (+432% over 5 years) and a sense that, at some point, the run has to end. Align Technology (NASDAQ: ALGN ), SaaS peer Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK ), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ), Square (NYSE: SQ ) - they all seem to invoke the same reaction. Yes, this is a great business - but the run in the stock has to stop at some point, right? Surely, valuation matters?
Of course, one problem is that investors have made that argument for some time. And those of us who have been wrong (as I have been on both Netflix and Square ) are loathe to make that same case elsewhere. Street analysts seem to be constantly catching up (CRM stock, once again, is nearing consensus targets). And shareholders - perhaps, wisely - can dismiss any valuation concerns as short-sighted. After all, weren't writers and analysts questioning CRM at $60? And NFLX at $200?
How an investor reacts in the case of CRM stock in many ways comes down to that investor's larger trading strategy. For some, there's a simple reason to buy CRM stock: it's silly to fight the tape. As long as the ""story"" continues, the stock can keep rising.
10 A-Rated Financial Stocks to Consider
For others, the gains seem unsustainable. Whether it's FOMO (fear of missing out), low interest rates or a central bank-induced bubble, valuations have run amok. And at some point, the bill will come due. If that's the case, CRM stock could plunge.
The important question, however, is when - and how far.
As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

In first-quarter 2018, earnings of 53 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Gross revenues of $2.58 billion jumped 12% year over year (up 7% on an Fx-neutral basis) and were within the guided range of $2.57-$2.61 billion.
We expect eBay to perform well on the back of strength in its marketplaces active users and net transaction revenues.
Shares of eBay have gained 1.5% in the past 12 months, significantly underperforming the industry 's 44.4% rally.
Marketplaces Active Buyers to Drive Growth
In the first quarter, eBay's marketplaces active buyers increased 2% from the year-ago period, amounting to a total of 171 million. We expect significant additions in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this metric is currently pegged at 173 million.
eBay's accelerated Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts through personalization, image search technology and customer support are expected to strengthen the Marketplace platform.
Moreover, eBay has been giving more data to its marketplace sellers including price and restocking guidance, as well as more insight into inventory such as demand signals for the right products, price, and timing.
Core Platform Strength to Drive Net Transaction Revenues
In the first quarter, eBay's total net transaction revenues were $2.02 billion. The figure is expected to increase in the to-be-reported quarter as eBay has been strengthening its core platform and improving user experience.
The company accelerated its efforts by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse-inspired shopping journeys, rejuvenating customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthening its brand.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net transaction revenues is currently pegged at $2.1 billion.
Overhangs Remain
Concerns remain in the form of increasing competition in the e-commerce from companies like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT), as well as deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally.
eBay's increased investment toward overall platform technology and slower growth rate compared to peers are also overhangs. Moreover, eBay's growth continues to suffer due to weak world economy. The company is heavily dependent on countries outside the United States for transaction and Internet sales. However, the United States is flourishing whereas emerging economies are slowing down.
What Our Model Says
According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP . You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.
eBay has an Earnings ESP of +0.39% but a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes our surprise prediction difficult.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Without new chips, data centers couldn't run, cloud services would fail, and the development of consumer electronics would stall out. That's why the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the main benchmark of the growing industry, has more than doubled over the past three years.
However, it can be tough for investors to identify decent semiconductor investments beyond market leaders like Intel and NVIDIA . So today, let's highlight four other top semiconductor stocks that could deliver big returns.
Cypress Semiconductor
Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ: CY) is the market leader in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) chips, NOR and SRAM memory chips, USB-C controllers, and auto instrument cluster microcontrollers. Cypress generates most of its revenue from the automotive and industrial IoT markets, and its ""Cypress 3.0"" strategy aims to make the chipmaker a one-stop shop for various IoT needs.
The company has three core strengths. First, it dominates niche markets that are largely overlooked by bigger chipmakers. Second, it sells its chips in bundles, which locks in customers and helps it gain content share in cars and industrial machines. Lastly, rising sales of connected cars and the automation of factories should buoy its sales over the long term.
Wall Street expects Cypress' revenue to rise 7% this year as its earnings climb 39%. The stock trades at less than 14x forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 2.7%. Those numbers look solid, but the stock remains weighed down by near-term concerns about China and peaking auto sales.
Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) sells a wide variety of analog and embedded chips for automakers, industrial IoT machinery, and consumer electronics. Over the past few years, the company shifted its production from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which cut its average production costs by about 40%. That's how Texas Instruments continually expanded its margins as many other chipmakers struggled.
The company has two main strengths. First, its focus on low-end analog and embedded chips keeps its margins high, as the company can avoid direct competition with bigger chipmakers. Second, it's so well diversified that it can easily offset slowdowns in one market (like consumer electronics) with growth in other markets (like connected cars and industrial machines).
Analysts expect Texas Instruments' revenue and earnings to rise 7% and 26%, respectively, in 2018. Its stock trades at a reasonable 20x forward earnings, and it pays a forward yield of 2.2%. Shareholders have enjoyed annual payout increases for 14 straight years, which reduced its share count by a whopping 43% during that period.
AMD
AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) is the second largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs in the world. It trails Intel and NVIDIA in those markets, respectively, but its chips are still popular with budget OEMs and consumers. AMD also merges its CPU and GPU technologies in single APU chipsets -- which power the PS4, Xbox One, and various gaming laptops.
AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which supplies APUs to console makers, often supports its core business if its CPU and GPU sales waver. Instead of staying in the low-end market, AMD is challenging Intel and NVIDIA with higher-end chips. Its Ryzen chips are already claiming market share from Intel in desktops, while its new Vega chips won back some market share from NVIDIA during the first quarter, according to research firm JPR.
Many tech analysts seem unsure if AMD can keep landing body blows against its larger, more well-heeled rivals. Nonetheless, they still expect revenue to rise 26% this year as its earnings nearly triple. Those are stellar growth rates, even for a stock that trades at about 35x earnings.
Xilinx
Back in the 1980s, Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) invented a new class of programmable chipsets called FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), which could be reprogrammed after being shipped. Today, Xilinx is the world's top maker of FPGAs, which are used across a wide range of industries. Its only meaningful competitor is Intel, which acquired Xilinx's top competitor Altera in 2015.
Xilinx generates its revenue from three core markets -- Communications and Data Center customers; Industrial, Aerospace and Defense customers; and Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive customers. Xilinx's Communications and Data Center market was its weakest one last quarter, but that softness was offset by the double-digit sales growth from the other two segments. Many of its newer chips are used for AI and machine learning tasks.
Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue to rise 8% this year, and for its earnings -- which dipped on higher expenses last year -- to grow 38%. Xilinx trades at 24x earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of 2.1%. Investors shouldn't buy a stock based on buyout buzz alone, but Xilinx has often been cited as a takeover target following Intel's takeover of Altera.

Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.
What to Expect?
The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this consumer goods giant will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the second quarter like the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the impending quarter is pegged at 77 cents, which reflects year-over-year growth of 6.9%. However, estimates moved south by a penny in the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $3.97 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.
Factors Likely to Influence 2Q18
Colgate is progressing well with its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs to improve gross and operating profits, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and increasing its market share worldwide. Also, the company is on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives.
In addition to its solid brand portfolio, Colgate remains focused on innovation and in-store implementation to drive growth. This, in turn, has enabled it to capture market share across all regions and categories. With regards to innovation, the company is rolling out the Naturals range in various markets. All these endeavors are likely to boost the upcoming quarterly results.
For 2018, management projects net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth in low- to mid-single digit. Also, it anticipates low-double-digit earnings per share growth, on an adjusted basis.
However, Colgate has been witnessing strained margins due to higher raw material and packaging costs. Notably, the company reported second straight quarter of gross margin contraction and fourth consecutive quarter of operating margin decline in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, management expects the backdrop to remain challenging in 2018 due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide.
Nevertheless, Colgate anticipates strong cash flow generation, gross margin expansion and higher advertising investments in the current year.
A Glance at Zacks Model
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Colgate has an Earnings ESP of +0.07%. However, the company's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult.
Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:
The Boston Beer Company, Inc. SAM has an Earnings ESP of +13.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
Dean Foods Company DF has an Earnings ESP of +10.35% and a Zacks Rank of 3.
Monster Beverage Corporation MNST has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 33.3%. Nokia surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 52.8%.
Factors at Play
During the second quarter, Nokia inked a deal to acquire SpaceTime Insight, a California-based IoT (Internet of Things) startup, for an undisclosed amount. The deal is aimed at expanding Nokia's IoT portfolio and analytics capabilities while expediting the development of new IoT applications for key vertical markets. The buyout supports Nokia's software strategy and leverages SpaceTime's sales expertise and proven track record in IoT application development, machine learning and data science to augment the efficacy of the Nokia Software IoT product unit.
During the quarter, the company announced the launch of a new 5G design concept and deployment services, which will help operators reduce time-to-market cost effectively. The company also completed an end-to-end 5G New Radio data call in China. The 3GPP-compliant dual connectivity trial was conducted by the 5G Technology R&D team of the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
Nokia, in collaboration with Orange, completed a live network trial in Poland, in an effort to demonstrate how the use of cloud optimized Radio Access Network (RAN) will benefit the progression to 5G. This cloud RAN trial was the first of its kind in operational LTE network in Europe to be conducted using the operator's own cloud infrastructure. The trial marked an important milestone in Orange's upcoming distributed cloud architecture for 5G. The AirScale Cloud RAN of Nokia provides the flexibility as and when different requirements for 5G, IoT, low-latency services and end-to-end slicing crop up.
Nokia entered into an agreement with IT firm HCL Technologies to streamline and modernize its outsourced IT management services. The five-year deal entails HCL to integrate the services of four current vendors into a single IT services delivery and design framework with the help of a transformation roadmap.
All these collaborations and product launches are likely to result in incremental revenues in the near future. However, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $6,084 million, down from $6,180 million reported in the year-earlier quarter as the industry faces soft demands on challenging macroeconomic environment. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at 4 cents, down from 9 cents reported a year ago.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.
Earnings ESP: Nokia has an Earnings ESP of -25.00%, as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 3 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 4 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
Nokia Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nokia Corporation Quote
Zacks Rank: Nokia currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's negative ESP acts as a spoiler.
We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:
Corning Incorporated GLW has an Earnings ESP of +1.37% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% and a Zacks Rank #2.
KEMET Corporation KEM has an Earnings ESP of +2.47% and a Zacks Rank #2.
The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All
Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.
Factors Likely to Influence the Quarter
Spectrum Brands has been undertaking strategic steps to manage its business portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. Recently, the company has completed its merger with HRG Group, Inc. - its largest shareholder with a 60% controlling stake. This deal made Spectrum Brands an independent company, thereby enhancing its shareholder base and governance structure besides driving business growth.
Additionally, the company has inked a $2-billion cash deal with Energizer Holdings to offload its Global Battery and Lighting Business. Currently, Spectrum Brands is seeking regulatory approvals for this transaction. Spectrum Brands will use the divestiture proceeds for debt reduction, reinvestment in core businesses both organically and via strategic buyouts as well as share buybacks. Management also plans to redirect the capital invested in the Global Batteries & Appliances business toward development of its remaining four businesses, including Hardware & Home Improvement, Global Auto Care, Global Pet Supplies and Home & Garden. These strategic moves are likely to strengthen the company's operating structure and boost its profitability.
Spectrum Brands boasts a robust brand portfolio and remains committed toward maximizing its shareholders' value by efficient capital allocation. All these factors make us optimistic about the company's upcoming quarterly performance.
However, challenges related to the company's greenfield manufacturing and distribution projects along with issues in pet business, and external cost headwinds and mix adversely impacted results in second-quarter fiscal 2018.
In addition, Spectrum Brands has been witnessing strained margins for the last few quarters due to higher operating and SG&A expenses. In fact, soft operating margins have been hurting the company's profitability.
Zacks Model
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Spectrum Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates in the fiscal third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Spectrum Brands has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about earnings beat.
Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:
The Boston Beer Company, Inc. SAM has an Earnings ESP of +13.00% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
Dean Foods Company DF has an Earnings ESP of +10.35% and a Zacks Rank of 3.
Monster Beverage Corporation MNST has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is set to report second quarter numbers after the bell today, July 25.
AMD earnings promise to present a lot of volatility. It is naturally a volatile stock that always bounces big around earnings. According to the options market, which is pricing in a 10%-plus weekly move, this time will be no different.
I also think AMD earnings will cause a lot of noise. After all, this is a stock which has shot up nearly 50% since its last earnings report. Meanwhile, the percent of the float short is above 20%, which is near multiyear highs.
Clearly, both bulls and bears have a lot of conviction about where the stock will go after earnings.
Who is right? Tough to say. AMD earnings are always wild. The company always tops estimates but the stock price reaction is usually unpredictable.
From my standpoint, this stock is fairly valued around $16, and should head towards $17 by the end of the year. Thus, strong AMD earnings could send the stock marginally higher. But, I don't see explosive gains ahead. Moreover, I also think there is risk of a sell-off due to super-charged buy-side expectations.
10 Stocks to Play a Trillion-Dollar IOT Space
As such, when it comes to AMD earnings, I'm sitting on the sidelines.
Here's a deeper look.
AMD Earnings May Be Very Good, But Stock Price Reaction Remains Uncertain
I think AMD's numbers will be quite good.
The secular growth drivers supporting AMD's growth narrative - including dominance in the gaming market and growing market share in the data center, AI and cloud computing markets - remain strong today. If anything, I think they've actually strengthened as Epyc has scaled and gained more market share in high-end computing.
Consequently, I'm expecting a double beat quarter from AMD.
But, that has become the norm. AMD earnings are always double beat events. Since the start of fiscal 2016, AMD has reported double beats in eight of its nine quarters, including four straight double beat quarters.
Despite that solid earnings performance, AMD stock doesn't always respond well to strong earnings. Over the past year, while AMD earnings have been consistently well-above expectations, AMD stock is up just 13%, below the market-average return of 14%.
Moreover, there was a point during that stretch when AMD stock was down nearly 35%.
Thus, while AMD earnings will likely be strong, the stock price reaction remains a huge question mark. That question mark is emphasized by the fact that AMD stock has rallied nearly 50% since its last earnings report, implying that huge buy-side expectations are already priced in. The likelihood that those expectations are met is slim.
AMD Stock Will Be Higher By the End of the Year
Although I am uncertain as to how AMD stock will react to strong earnings, I am certain that AMD stock will be higher by the end of the year.
This is a company with solid long-term growth drivers through growing market share in key secular growth markets like data-centers, AI, automation and cloud computing. Those markets also carry higher margins. Plus, robust revenue growth should drive opex leverage. Overall, then, this is a big growth company with healthy margin drivers.
I peg the company's long-term growth prospects at 15% revenue growth per year with long-term operating margin potential of 14%, in-line with management's long-term guide. Under those assumptions, I think that AMD can do about $1.15 in earnings per share in five years.
A growth-average 20X multiple on that implies a four-year forward price target of $23. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a year-end price target of roughly $17.
Bottom Line on AMD Earnings
I think AMD earnings present a fair amount of risk for investors. As such, I'm not bullish on AMD stock into the report.
But, I do think that AMD stock will head higher by the end of the year. Consequently, I think that if this stock dips after earnings, that dip is a buying opportunity.

The company's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31. Also, the bottom line climbed 8% year over year, driven mainly by higher security subscriptions, reduced cost of revenues and a lower share count, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Fiscal second-quarter revenues came in at $468 million, up approximately 2% year over year. The revenue figure came within the company's guidance of $445-$475 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $461 million.
Its share price increased about 5.22% in the trading session following the results.

Quarter Details
Security subscription revenues continued to be strong at $132.1 million, increasing 12% year over year. However, revenues of $125.7 million from Products lagged the year-ago quarter by 9.1%.
Software updates and maintenance revenues increased to $210 million, representing 3.8% growth.
Geographically, the Americas generated 48% of the total revenues, Europe accounted for 36% of total revenues, while the Asia Pacific, Japan and the Middle East and Africa accounted for the remaining 16%.
Notably, performance of the U.S sales force, which had negatively impacted the revenues of the previous quarter, showed improvement in the fiscal second quarter and results were on par with the company's expectation.
Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more - totaled 58. Customers, who signed deals worth $50,000 and more, contributed 76% to the total order value.
Operating Results
Non-GAAP operating income came in at $247.1 million, falling 0.4% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) tos 52.8%. This can be attributed to increased investments in sales and marketing efforts by the company.
Non-GAAP net income was $218.2 million or $1.37 per share, up from $212 million or $1.26 reported in the year-earlier quarter.
Balance Sheet & Other Financial Details

2018-07-26,AMD,18.350000381469727,18.450000762939453,16.829999923706055,17.15999984741211,192661100.0,3.0,0.4904549450364968,17.84688827443221,14.687111836194012,65.8696720126027,203.9595189074761,38.502318020094286,16.17600008646647,14.7625,12.140000343322754,1043.7699322416736,3.0,2.0,"Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) recently jumped after the company posted its second quarter earnings on July 19. However, the rally was surprising since TSMC's numbers weren't that impressive.
TSMC's revenue rose 9% annually to $233.28 billion NT dollars ($7.85 billion), which matched analyst estimates. That represented 11% growth in U.S. dollars due to year-over-year shifts in exchange rates. Its EPS rose 9% to $2.79 NTD, or $0.47 per ADR share, which beat expectations by a penny.
But for the current quarter, TSMC only expects 1.6% to 2.8% annual sales growth (in U.S. dollars), compared to the consensus forecast for 2.9% growth. It also slashed its full year sales guidance to 7% to 9%, compared to its forecast for 10% growth back in April -- which was already a reduction from its prior forecast for 10% to 15% growth.
However, a key difference was that this time TSMC only attributed its guidance cut to slower demand for cryptocurrency mining chips, which could be partly offset by stronger demand for chips for new premium smartphones. Back in April, TSMC blamed its guidance cut on slower demand in both the crypto mining and smartphone markets.
That might seem like a minor difference, but it convinced some analysts and investors that TSMC's sales could rebound in 2019. However, TSMC's recovery still depends heavily on new premium phones reviving the stagnant smartphone market and chipmakers launching new 7nm chipsets.
Understanding the challenges
TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry. It produces nearly 10,000 types of products for almost 500 active customers -- including NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . So when TSMC sneezes, everyone assumes that the semiconductor sector has caught a cold.
Furthermore, TSMC cut its full-year sales forecast for the entire semiconductor industry (excluding memory chips) from 5%-7% to just 5% back in April, which seemed to indicate that the semiconductor market was approaching a cyclical peak. Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China could also throttle chip sales into China and raise prices on a wide range of electronics.
TSMC mostly attributed its slowdown to a gradual shift toward newer 7nm chip designs, which are expected to account for over 20% of its revenues during the fourth quarter and subsequently grow more than 10% per year. But revenues from 10nm chips (which generated over a fifth of its revenues last year) and other older chips are still declining.
What does this mean for chipmakers?
TSMC's shift toward newer 7nm designs tells us a lot about its top customers. For NVIDIA, this means that demand for its current-gen 14nm and 16nm Pascal GPUs is peaking. The same can be said about AMD's current-gen 14nm Vega GPUs and Zen CPUs. Moreover, soft crypto prices are causing prices for used GPUs to decline, which could cause a global glut of cheap GPUs. The ongoing price war between NVIDIA and AMD in low-end GPUs could exacerbate that pain.
NVIDIA's high-end Volta GPUs are 12nm chips, but its next-gen GPUs are widely expected to be 7nm chips. Recent reports suggest that those chips could arrive by the end of the year. AMD also plans to make the leap to 7nm with its next-gen Vega GPUs and Zen 2 CPUs, which should arrive in 2019.
Apple, which jumped from 16nm to 10mm chips with the A10X and A11 chips last year, recently started production on its 7nm A12 chips. Those chips should debut in its trio of new iPhones this fall . Other major TSMC customers like Qualcomm , the top mobile chipmaker in the world, are performing similar upgrades.
Getting ready for the next cycle
On their own, TSMC's second quarter earnings and guidance look bleak for semiconductor stocks . However, new 7nm chips should lead the charge next year -- not only in smartphones, but in an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, connected cars, and GPUs for gaming and AI.
Therefore, TSMC's slowdown shouldn't be considered a red flag for semiconductor stocks yet. Instead, it should be considered a temporary dip that might precede bigger gains next year.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new September 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $62.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.47/share today.
Because the $62.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.39% return on the cash commitment, or 28.75% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $62.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $63.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of MNST stock at the current price level of $62.47/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $63.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.37% if the stock gets called away at the September 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MNST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MNST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $63.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $63.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.89% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $62.47) to be 27%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $70.12 per unit.
With QQEW trading at a recent price near $62.73 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.78% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), T-Mobile US Inc (Symbol: TMUS), and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Symbol: BMRN). Although EBAY has traded at a recent price of $33.81/share, the average analyst target is 32.27% higher at $44.72/share. Similarly, TMUS has 25.97% upside from the recent share price of $59.61 if the average analyst target price of $75.09/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BMRN to reach a target price of $116.44/share, which is 16.40% above the recent price of $100.04. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of EBAY, TMUS, and BMRN:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

I'm sure many shareholders are questioning why Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) dropped so sharply. Intel stock fell 8.6% on Friday. That's not quite a move on the level of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) or Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), both of which plunged after their own earnings announcement. But for a company with a $240 billion market cap (still), an 8%+ move is big - and rare.
7 Best Stocks to Buy to Upgrade Your AI Portfolio
Yet, there doesn't seem to be that much bad news in the report. Revenue and earnings per share both handily beat consensus estimates . Weakness in the data center business appears to be the culprit of the decline - but Intel's revenue in that category still rose 27% year over year. Sales overall rose 15%. Adjusted EPS increased 44%. And Intel stock now trades at barely 11 times next year's consensus EPS.
It doesn't seem to add up. And on this site, Luke Lango made the case for buying the dip in Intel stock. It's a solid argument. INTC is cheap; it's still a leader in the semiconductor space; and Lango's price target of $52 suggests reasonable upside in concert with a 2.5% dividend yield.
But I'm not quite as optimistic. I thought INTC, then trading at $51, already had made its run back in April. Back at $47, I'm not sure the discount is quite great enough to offset the potential risks here.
Competition Is Coming
It's not hard to see why investors focused on Intel's data center revenue figure. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) soared after a blowout quarter announced the day before Intel's release. AMD's strength clearly was driven by its EPYC processors - which are targeting that very same data center market.
AMD's unexpected strength in that category, along with Intel's admittedly modest miss relative to expectations, creates an obvious narrative here. AMD is taking share in a market in which it had essentially zero presence until recently. No less than former Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has admitted that AMD could wind up with 15-20% market share .
And AMD isn't even the biggest worry. That title goes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which grew its data center revenue 71% in its most recent quarter. Nvidia's $700 million in data center sales pale, at the moment, to the $5.5 billion generated by Intel's Data Center Group. And - for now - demand is strong enough that the rising tide is lifting all boats.
Still, in a key category, investors clearly are worried that Intel's boat has a leak or two (to stretch the metaphor). For a business driving roughly 30% of Intel sales, that's not something that can be ignored.
Execution Needs to Be Better
Intel's ability to answer that competition is going to come down to its ability to execute and innovate. But there, too, concerns are rising. The company's move to 10nm was delayed by a year, into the second half of 2019. As Merrill Lynch analysts pointed out, that opens the door for not just AMD and Nvidia, but Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) and Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ).
Meanwhile, Intel still lacks a CEO after Krzanich resigned last month. Though many shareholders shrugged at the news - and some were downright happy - I still think, as I argued at the time, that the loss is bad news for Intel . Whatever the criticisms of Krzanich - and there are plenty - Intel is navigating a challenging period and aggressive competitors without a permanent chief executive. Clearly, at least in the near-term, that is making investors uncomfortable.
Is Intel Stock Cheap Enough?
All that said, there's a case that at least some, if not all, of the risks are baked into the INTC stock price at this point. Again, the stock trades at barely 11 times 2019 consensus EPS. The PC business looks worrisome, given weak unit growth worldwide, and AMD's efforts with its Ryzen line . But ""PC-centric"" revenue rose 6% in Q2, a solid performance that seems to suggest Intel can still squeeze some growth out of its CPUs.
Data center revenue still is growing. Mobileye, acquired last year, grew revenue 37%, and the automotive opportunity is enormous longer-term. The 'Internet of Things' and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) offer additional secular growth tailwinds.
10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy on This Dip
Still, about half of Intel revenue still comes from PCs - and that business could fade longer-term. And at the moment, as a business, it's hard to argue that Intel is living up to its reputation. The news may not be quite as bad as the stock price suggests - but it isn't great. There are real risks here, and some questions that Intel will need to answer over the next few quarters.

I'm sure many shareholders are questioning why Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) dropped so sharply. Intel stock fell 8.6% on Friday. That's not quite a move on the level of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) or Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), both of which plunged after their own earnings announcement. But for a company with a $240 billion market cap (still), an 8%+ move is big - and rare.
7 Best Stocks to Buy to Upgrade Your AI Portfolio
Yet, there doesn't seem to be that much bad news in the report. Revenue and earnings per share both handily beat consensus estimates . Weakness in the data center business appears to be the culprit of the decline - but Intel's revenue in that category still rose 27% year over year. Sales overall rose 15%. Adjusted EPS increased 44%. And Intel stock now trades at barely 11 times next year's consensus EPS.
It doesn't seem to add up. And on this site, Luke Lango made the case for buying the dip in Intel stock. It's a solid argument. INTC is cheap; it's still a leader in the semiconductor space; and Lango's price target of $52 suggests reasonable upside in concert with a 2.5% dividend yield.
But I'm not quite as optimistic. I thought INTC, then trading at $51, already had made its run back in April. Back at $47, I'm not sure the discount is quite great enough to offset the potential risks here.
Competition Is Coming
It's not hard to see why investors focused on Intel's data center revenue figure. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) soared after a blowout quarter announced the day before Intel's release. AMD's strength clearly was driven by its EPYC processors - which are targeting that very same data center market.
AMD's unexpected strength in that category, along with Intel's admittedly modest miss relative to expectations, creates an obvious narrative here. AMD is taking share in a market in which it had essentially zero presence until recently. No less than former Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has admitted that AMD could wind up with 15-20% market share .
And AMD isn't even the biggest worry. That title goes to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which grew its data center revenue 71% in its most recent quarter. Nvidia's $700 million in data center sales pale, at the moment, to the $5.5 billion generated by Intel's Data Center Group. And - for now - demand is strong enough that the rising tide is lifting all boats.
Still, in a key category, investors clearly are worried that Intel's boat has a leak or two (to stretch the metaphor). For a business driving roughly 30% of Intel sales, that's not something that can be ignored.
Execution Needs to Be Better
Intel's ability to answer that competition is going to come down to its ability to execute and innovate. But there, too, concerns are rising. The company's move to 10nm was delayed by a year, into the second half of 2019. As Merrill Lynch analysts pointed out, that opens the door for not just AMD and Nvidia, but Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ) and Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ).
Meanwhile, Intel still lacks a CEO after Krzanich resigned last month. Though many shareholders shrugged at the news - and some were downright happy - I still think, as I argued at the time, that the loss is bad news for Intel . Whatever the criticisms of Krzanich - and there are plenty - Intel is navigating a challenging period and aggressive competitors without a permanent chief executive. Clearly, at least in the near-term, that is making investors uncomfortable.
Is Intel Stock Cheap Enough?
All that said, there's a case that at least some, if not all, of the risks are baked into the INTC stock price at this point. Again, the stock trades at barely 11 times 2019 consensus EPS. The PC business looks worrisome, given weak unit growth worldwide, and AMD's efforts with its Ryzen line . But ""PC-centric"" revenue rose 6% in Q2, a solid performance that seems to suggest Intel can still squeeze some growth out of its CPUs.
Data center revenue still is growing. Mobileye, acquired last year, grew revenue 37%, and the automotive opportunity is enormous longer-term. The 'Internet of Things' and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) offer additional secular growth tailwinds.
10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy on This Dip
Still, about half of Intel revenue still comes from PCs - and that business could fade longer-term. And at the moment, as a business, it's hard to argue that Intel is living up to its reputation. The news may not be quite as bad as the stock price suggests - but it isn't great. There are real risks here, and some questions that Intel will need to answer over the next few quarters.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investors are currently celebrating a big quarter, with AAPL stock continuing its march toward a $1 trillion market cap. However, one bit of news hit yesterday that took a little of the shine off. Multiple industry trackers are reporting that Huawei overtook Apple last quarter to become the world's second largest smartphone vendor.
With the iPhone so critical to AAPL stock, is this something for Apple investors to be concerned about?
IDC: Huawei Surges Past Apple to Take Second Place in Smartphone Sales
China's Huawei is on a roll when it comes to smartphone sales. Major industry trackers, including IDC, IHS Markit and Canalys all agree that Huawei saw very strong growth in the previous quarter (ending June 30), leapfrogging Apple to take second place in world smartphone sales.
10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy on This Dip
And it looks like it wasn't even close. According to IDC's numbers , first place Samsung had a 20.9% share of global smartphone shipments. Second place Huawei had 15.8% and third place Apple was at 12.1%. What makes Huawei's performance even more impressive is that the company managed to grow its quarterly shipments by 40.9% year-over-year, at a time where the overall smartphone market shrank by 1.8%. And it did this despite being shut out of the U.S. , after efforts to partner with American wireless carriers at the start of the year were blocked. Anyone wanting to want to buy Huawei smartphones in the U.S. has to look for unlocked versions through websites like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ).
IDC says this is the first time iPhone sales have put Apple in third spot in seven years. However, Counterpoint Research did publish a report that Huwaei had bumped Apple at about the same time last year. Other industry trackers did not agree, and by the next quarter, Apple was firmly back in second place - by everyone's measurements.
Not Time for Apple to Panic
Obviously, being bumped into third place is not great news for Apple, but this is also not something to panic about. It's more bragging rights than something that would cause AAPL stock to take a hit.
And it's also not as bad as it may look for Apple, once you look more closely at the data. Despite slipping to third spot, IDC reports Apple iPhone shipments did eke out 0.7% year-over-year growth on the quarter. That's despite selling models like the iPhone X that are more expensive than ever, amid an overall contraction in the global smartphone market. Rival Samsung remained in top place, but its shipments dropped by 10.4% on the quarter.
In addition, the numbers are for a traditionally slower sales period for Apple. Consumers begin to put off iPhone purchases as rumors about the next generation models hit the headlines. Look for AAPL to regain second place once those new iPhones launch.
The bigger threat in the long term isn't that Huawei took second place, however.
Much of its volume is in entry level and midrange phones like the $200 Honor 7X, so it can drive huge unit sales by hitting markets like India and China where many buyers are price sensitive. However, the company has begun producing flagship smartphones like the P20 Pro that are selling in the $800 price range. In the long term, buyers of entry level Huawei smartphones may choose a P20 Pro when they can afford an upgrade, instead of an iPhone or Galaxy. Once established as a premium smartphone maker, Huawei could siphon sales from other flagship competitors, attracting upgraders from rival brands.
That specific issue is probably far off yet, and Android smartphone manufacturers like Samsung will be at bigger risk than Apple - it's far easier to make a leap from one Android phone to another.

So for now AAPL investors can enjoy the Q3 earnings results and watch AAPL stock continue to climb. But they should keep one eye on Huawei …
As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MNST options chain for the new September 14th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $58.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $58.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MNST, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $58.99/share today.
Because the $58.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.42% return on the cash commitment, or 29.02% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , and highlighting in green where the $58.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $59.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of MNST stock at the current price level of $58.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $59.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.42% if the stock gets called away at the September 14th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MNST shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Monster Beverage Corp , as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MNST's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $59.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $59.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 30.22% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $58.99) to be 27%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Yet these fears seem to be overblown. Plus, Micron stock offers one of the better values of any tech stock and the company looks poised to grow, with secular trends set to help drive the semiconductor firm forward.
Overview
Some investors turned their back on Micron and other companies with exposure in China based on fears that the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies will be a drag on profits. China did account for roughly 50% of the company's most recent full-year revenues.
With that said, China has concentrated its tariffs on agricultural products, manufacturing supplies, and other larger goods in response to the U.S. And of Micron's $19.4 billion in net property, plant, and equipment, just $453 million is from China.
Some are also nervous that Micron has been the beneficiary of cyclical growth trends. In years and decades past, often dominated by PCs, there would have been more reason to think MU was due for a pullback. But today, the ubiquity of data storage and memory needs, for everything from cloud computing to AI, set Micron up for serious secular expansion. ""We stand to benefit from the significant investments cloud service providers are making to build out their IT infrastructure,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on Micron's Q3earnings callin late June.
""In summary, we continue to see strong market demand for memory and fast storage products due to the value these solutions provide in an economy where data-and fast access to that data-is increasingly important,"" Micron's chief executive continued. ""Growing capabilities in the data center have enabled greater functionality at the edge, increasing users and creating more data and, in turn, driving opportunities for expanded, higher-value data services. We believe this virtuous cycle has driven the secular growth patterns we are currently seeing across nearly all of our markets and believe that it will persist into the foreseeable future.""
Price Movement
Shares of Micron have slipped roughly 1% during the last month. Still, MU stock has soared 270% over the last two years. This climb crushes Amazon's AMZN 145% and its industry's 72%, which includes the likes of Intel INTC , Advanced Micro Devices AMD , and Texas Instruments TXN . Micron stock is also up nearly 90% over the last 12 months but has experienced some rather large turbulence since the start of 2018.
Valuation
At $53.39 per share, Micron stock closed over $10 below its 52-week high of $64.66 on Wednesday.Therefore, MU stock is less expensive than it has been over the last year based on price alone. Micron is also currently trading at 4.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which represents a significant discount compared to its industry's 11.1X average, the S&P's 17.4X, and blows away fellow chip power Nvidia's NVDA 35.8X.
MU stock has traded as high as 6.8X over the last year, with a one-year median of 5.4X. Micron is trading above its year-long low of 4.1X, but MU still offers insane value and looks rather cheap compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.
Outlook
Micron's fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to surge nearly 34% to hit $8.22 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the company's full-year revenues are projected to climb 48% to reach $30.13 billion.
The firm's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar over 63% to touch $3.30 per share, while its full-year earnings are expected to skyrocket 136%.
MU has also earned six upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, against zero downward changes over the last 60 days. More importantly, Micron has received eight revisions for the full-year during this same timeframe, with 100% agreement to the upside-and seven for fiscal 2019.
Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an ""A"" grade for Value and a ""B"" for Growth in our Style Scores system.

But today, the ubiquity of data storage and memory needs, for everything from cloud computing to AI, set Micron up for serious secular expansion. ""We stand to benefit from the significant investments cloud service providers are making to build out their IT infrastructure,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on Micron's Q3earnings callin late June.
""In summary, we continue to see strong market demand for memory and fast storage products due to the value these solutions provide in an economy where data-and fast access to that data-is increasingly important,"" Micron's chief executive continued. ""Growing capabilities in the data center have enabled greater functionality at the edge, increasing users and creating more data and, in turn, driving opportunities for expanded, higher-value data services. We believe this virtuous cycle has driven the secular growth patterns we are currently seeing across nearly all of our markets and believe that it will persist into the foreseeable future.""
Price Movement
Shares of Micron have slipped roughly 1% during the last month. Still, MU stock has soared 270% over the last two years. This climb crushes Amazon's AMZN 145% and its industry's 72%, which includes the likes of Intel INTC , Advanced Micro Devices AMD , and Texas Instruments TXN . Micron stock is also up nearly 90% over the last 12 months but has experienced some rather large turbulence since the start of 2018.
Valuation
At $53.39 per share, Micron stock closed over $10 below its 52-week high of $64.66 on Wednesday.Therefore, MU stock is less expensive than it has been over the last year based on price alone. Micron is also currently trading at 4.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which represents a significant discount compared to its industry's 11.1X average, the S&P's 17.4X, and blows away fellow chip power Nvidia's NVDA 35.8X.
MU stock has traded as high as 6.8X over the last year, with a one-year median of 5.4X. Micron is trading above its year-long low of 4.1X, but MU still offers insane value and looks rather cheap compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.
Outlook
Micron's fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to surge nearly 34% to hit $8.22 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the company's full-year revenues are projected to climb 48% to reach $30.13 billion.
The firm's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar over 63% to touch $3.30 per share, while its full-year earnings are expected to skyrocket 136%.
MU has also earned six upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter, against zero downward changes over the last 60 days. More importantly, Micron has received eight revisions for the full-year during this same timeframe, with 100% agreement to the upside-and seven for fiscal 2019.
Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and rocks an ""A"" grade for Value and a ""B"" for Growth in our Style Scores system.

U.S. stock futures are mixed heading into the open. Wall Street is in earnings and economic data mode this morning, leaving the U.S./China trade war in the back seat for now.
Economic data could set the tone for today's session, including reports on weekly jobless claims , the July producer-price index and June wholesale inventories.
Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.9% while S&P 500 futures are up 0.11%. Nasdaq-100 futures, meanwhile, have added 0.08%.
In the options pits, volume was considerably light on Wednesday. Only about 15.3 million calls and 13.8 million puts changed hands on the session. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio pulled back to 0.62. The 10-day moving average held its ground at 0.64.
Options traders crashed into Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) yesterday following CEO Elon Musk's tweet about taking the company private at $420 per share. Elsewhere, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) saw activity spike ahead of next week's earnings, while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) received some blowback ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) quarterly report.
Let's take a closer look:
Tesla (TSLA)
In a midday tweet on Tuesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, ""Considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" The tweet put TSLA traders in a frenzy, sending the stock soaring and raising questions about whether or not Musk would, or even could, take Tesla private. The frenzy spilled over into the options pits yesterday, sending volume soaring.
The 10 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now
Today, the SEC is getting involved .
TSLA options traders are apparently used to these kinds of antics. Thursday's options activity was clearly divided between calls and puts, as traders were split on the potential outcomes of this week's latest Musk drama. Volume topped 530,000 contracts for TSLA yesterday, more than 2.4 times the stock's daily average.
Calls barely won out in the end, claiming 52% of the day's take. That said, puts are firmly in command in the back-month September series.
Currently, the September put/call open interest ratio rest at a lofty reading of 2.81, with puts nearly tripling calls in the series. This ratio has risen sharply this week, indicating that TSLA options traders aren't taking Musk's ""going private"" tweet seriously at all.
Alibaba (BABA)
We are two weeks away from an earnings report from Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba. Options traders are already salivating at the potential outcomes. Currently, Wall Street is expecting a profit of $1.23 per share from Alibaba, with revenue seen soaring 62.8% to $81.68 billion.
EarningsWhispers.com puts the whisper number at $1.27 per share, indicating that sentiment seems to be discounting the potential impact of the U.S./China trade war.
Options traders are doing the same. Yesterday, volume swelled to over 257,000 contracts, pushing activity to about 1.3 times Alibaba's daily average. Calls gobbled up 72% of the day's take.
Looking at monthly August options for BABA (which expire next week), the put/call OI ratio comes in at 0.67. In other words, traders are moderately bullish on BABA stock heading into next week's report.
However, we may not see the flair from a BABA post-earnings move that we are used to. August implied volatility is only pricing in a moderate move of about 3.65%
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Earnings reports in the semiconductor sector have ripple effects. Next Thursday, Nvidia will step up to release its quarterly report, and analysts are already predicting a noisy quarter for the graphics chip specialist. The repercussions of this report could create additional volatility for competitor AMD, and options traders are already preparing.
Volume yesterday came in at 183,000 contracts, about 65% of which were calls. AMD calls have been quite popular of late, after the company posted strong quarterly results and proved it was taking data center market share from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ).
Looking at August expiration, implied volatility is pricing in a 5.7% move for AMD stock in the wake of NVDA's quarterly report. That's a pretty impressive ripple, as it could take AMD past psychological resistance at $20 and help extend the stock's rally.
As of this writing, Joseph Hargett was long on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

All things considered, it can't be terribly surprising Wednesday's tepidness turned into an outright pullback - albeit a modest one - on Thursday. The bullish volume needed to keep a rally going never really materialized. With the proverbial tank running on empty, the S&P 500 was lucky to have not pulled back more than the 0.14% it did.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) proved to be the greatest drag, falling 2.5% as the weight of its recent gains continues to bear down. But, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) was the biggest noteworthy loser, sliding nearly 5% as doubts about the company going private have begun to surface.
That doesn't necessarily mean all trades from here have to be bearish ones. As the following stock charts of Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR ), Waters (NYSE: WAT ) and A.O. Smith (NYSE: AOS ) indicate, some stocks are still well-positioned to move higher. Others aren't.
Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR)
Most of the time, diving into a stock after a volatile intraday move isn't a good idea. There's just not enough certainty about how the market will feel the next day, when emotions have settled down.
The 10 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now
Nektar Therapeutics, though, is an exception to that rule of thumb. The fact that the stock initially reacted poorly to its second quarter numbers and then rebounded for a solid gain says the bulls are in charge even though the bears had their chance to topple it.
Click to Enlarge • Yesterday's daily bar is an engulfing bar, meaning the open and close were both below and above Wednesday's entire low-to-high action. Engulfing bars often indicate sweeping change, though in this case, the bulls were already moving into the stock for a couple of weeks heading into the Q2 report. The bulls were ready to see the news in a bullish light.
• A careful look at the daily chart also makes clear that Nektar Therapeutics shares found support at key short-term moving average lines, which is where you'd expect/want to find support.
• The weekly chart puts the big setback that set up this new uptrend in perspective. At the very least the buyers appear willing to try and close the gap left behind in early June. That gap's upper value is $76.80.
Waters (WAT)
With nothing more than a quick glance, Waters just looks like a volatile mess. A second, longer look though, reveals things aren't quite that simple. Buried within the erraticness are hints that the sellers are coming out of the woodwork even if we see occasional flashes of brilliance.
One or two more bad days could clarify those troubling hints, but it may be too late to act then.
Click to Enlarge • A careful look at the daily chart shows a head-and-shoulders pattern has not only taken shape, but that the neckline was just broken. Granted, it's not an ideal head-and-shoulders pattern, but they never are. The underlying spirit of the pattern says the bulls are increasingly bowing out, and the bears are increasingly emboldened.
• Backing out to a weekly chart of Waters, we can see that the last few months are all part of converging wedge pattern, the lower boundary of what actually extends back to the middle of last year. Sooner or later (and likely sooner than later), WAT is going to break out of this narrowing range.
• The current trend and volume clues suggest the bears are in charge, and ready to tip the chart over. Once the floor plotted on the weekly chart snaps, though, there's not much left in the way of floors that will hold back a wave of selling.
A.O. Smith (AOS)
For a while last month it looked like A.O. Smith would find a way of regrouping from June's meltdown. But, just within the past few days, the stock has started to drift lower, testing the waters of lower lows. Thursday's close of $58.13 was the lowest in weeks, and the bears never looked back.
Unfortunately, the hint to take here is a bearish one.
Click to Enlarge • This bigger-picture downtrend is well-developed, with the 200-day moving average line now pointed in a downward direction. Helping guide the stock lower is a falling resistance line that's developed just since July, marking every peak AOS has made since then.
• There's more bearish volume than bullish volume on the table too. The accumulation-distribution line has rolled over again.
• Zooming out to the weekly chart of A.O. Smith we can see the scope of this pullback. The rising support line that guided the stock upward since mid-2016 was also snapped in June. The sellers never looked back from that bigger-picture meltdown either.

All things considered, it can't be terribly surprising Wednesday's tepidness turned into an outright pullback - albeit a modest one - on Thursday. The bullish volume needed to keep a rally going never really materialized. With the proverbial tank running on empty, the S&P 500 was lucky to have not pulled back more than the 0.14% it did.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) proved to be the greatest drag, falling 2.5% as the weight of its recent gains continues to bear down. But, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) was the biggest noteworthy loser, sliding nearly 5% as doubts about the company going private have begun to surface.
That doesn't necessarily mean all trades from here have to be bearish ones. As the following stock charts of Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR ), Waters (NYSE: WAT ) and A.O. Smith (NYSE: AOS ) indicate, some stocks are still well-positioned to move higher. Others aren't.
Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR)
Most of the time, diving into a stock after a volatile intraday move isn't a good idea. There's just not enough certainty about how the market will feel the next day, when emotions have settled down.
The 10 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now
Nektar Therapeutics, though, is an exception to that rule of thumb. The fact that the stock initially reacted poorly to its second quarter numbers and then rebounded for a solid gain says the bulls are in charge even though the bears had their chance to topple it.
Click to Enlarge • Yesterday's daily bar is an engulfing bar, meaning the open and close were both below and above Wednesday's entire low-to-high action. Engulfing bars often indicate sweeping change, though in this case, the bulls were already moving into the stock for a couple of weeks heading into the Q2 report. The bulls were ready to see the news in a bullish light.
• A careful look at the daily chart also makes clear that Nektar Therapeutics shares found support at key short-term moving average lines, which is where you'd expect/want to find support.
• The weekly chart puts the big setback that set up this new uptrend in perspective. At the very least the buyers appear willing to try and close the gap left behind in early June. That gap's upper value is $76.80.
Waters (WAT)
With nothing more than a quick glance, Waters just looks like a volatile mess. A second, longer look though, reveals things aren't quite that simple. Buried within the erraticness are hints that the sellers are coming out of the woodwork even if we see occasional flashes of brilliance.
One or two more bad days could clarify those troubling hints, but it may be too late to act then.
Click to Enlarge • A careful look at the daily chart shows a head-and-shoulders pattern has not only taken shape, but that the neckline was just broken. Granted, it's not an ideal head-and-shoulders pattern, but they never are. The underlying spirit of the pattern says the bulls are increasingly bowing out, and the bears are increasingly emboldened.
• Backing out to a weekly chart of Waters, we can see that the last few months are all part of converging wedge pattern, the lower boundary of what actually extends back to the middle of last year. Sooner or later (and likely sooner than later), WAT is going to break out of this narrowing range.
• The current trend and volume clues suggest the bears are in charge, and ready to tip the chart over. Once the floor plotted on the weekly chart snaps, though, there's not much left in the way of floors that will hold back a wave of selling.
A.O. Smith (AOS)
For a while last month it looked like A.O. Smith would find a way of regrouping from June's meltdown. But, just within the past few days, the stock has started to drift lower, testing the waters of lower lows. Thursday's close of $58.13 was the lowest in weeks, and the bears never looked back.
Unfortunately, the hint to take here is a bearish one.
Click to Enlarge • This bigger-picture downtrend is well-developed, with the 200-day moving average line now pointed in a downward direction. Helping guide the stock lower is a falling resistance line that's developed just since July, marking every peak AOS has made since then.
• There's more bearish volume than bullish volume on the table too. The accumulation-distribution line has rolled over again.
• Zooming out to the weekly chart of A.O. Smith we can see the scope of this pullback. The rising support line that guided the stock upward since mid-2016 was also snapped in June. The sellers never looked back from that bigger-picture meltdown either.

The social media giant recently announced its plans to bring in new security features for Pages that have a large number of U.S. followers.
Page managers are required to verify their accounts by completing a two-step verification process. The process involves disclosing their location, which will be made visible to users following the Page.
Per TechCrunch, the latest measure comes after Facebook discovered campaigns that were built to politically influence users before the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections. Reportedly, the company has erased 17 profiles, 8 Pages and 7 Instagram accounts related to the campaigns.
Facebook owned Instagram will also be secured with similar features in the coming weeks.

Will Facebook's Measures Ensure User Safety?
Facebook has been investing heavily to secure its platform after being criticized about its data privacy issues.
The company is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent false news, hate speech, suicide attempts and other abuses from spreading quickly. Notably, its AI technology is successful in identifying 99% of terror content before anyone notices it.
Facebook has also appointed employees to keep a close watch on online campaigns to combat data leak threats in addition to its investments in AI. Additionally, talks of Facebook using blockchain technology for securing the data handling process are also doing the rounds.
Despite the attempts to tackle data privacy and fake account issues, investors' are becoming increasingly concerned about Facebook's user growth amid increasing competition from the likes of Twitter TWTR and Snap SNAP for advertising dollars.
Are Investors Losing Confidence in Facebook?
Facebook suffered its worst ever one-day drop of nearly 19% on Jul 25, following disappointing second-quarter results and near-term guidance. This erased nearly $120 billion from the stock's market capitalization, the largest one-day drop in the history of the American stock market.
Notably, Facebook managed to add only 22 million users worldwide in the second quarter, its lowest quarter-over-quarter jump since early 2011. The slowdown was primarily due to increased concerns over data privacy, security and fake news issues that Facebook has been encountering lately.
Moreover, weaker guidance for the period through 2019 due to deceleration in revenues and acceleration in expenses does not bode well for investors.
We believe that slowdown in Stories and Messenger monetization is likely to hurt top-line growth. Moreover, Facebook's aggressive investment amid increasing competition is expected to hurt profitability in the near term.

Reportedly, Turing features new RT Cores that make ray tracing 25 times faster than the old Pascal Architecture by computing how light and sound travel in 3D environments. Moreover, it features Tensor Cores - processors that accelerate deep-learning training and inferencing.
Concurrently, NVIDIA announced three graphic cards based on the technology, namely Quadro RTX 5000, 6000 and 8000, which will be up for sale for $2.3K, $6.3K and $10K, respectively, in the fourth quarter.
Notably, Quadro RTX GPUs are designed for use in film and video content creation, automotive and architectural design, and scientific visualization.
We believe the launch of the new GPU will help the company strengthen its competitive position against the likes of Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC , help it expand its footprint in several fast-growing fields and aid its top line.
Strong Adoption of NVIDIA's GPUs
NVIDIA's GPUs are rapidly penetrating the gaming and datacenter markets, which is driving top-line growth. Moreover, NVIDIA GPUs are gaining rapid traction with the proliferation of AI. The increasing usage of AI tools in datacenter, automotive, healthcare and manufacturing industries is likely to drive demand for GPUs in the long haul.
NVIDIA is already a dominant player in the datacenter market. The company enjoys a first-mover advantage in the AI field and its expanding product portfolio is capable enough to leverage the growing adoption of AI in various industries.
On the last conference call, management sounded optimistic regarding the rising traction in AI inference. NVIDIA said that more than 1,200 companies are using this inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft MSFT , Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, Hi Vision and Tencent.
Moreover, the real-time ray tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX is likely to take the gaming experience to a whole new level. Hence, the product launch will help NVIDIA expand its customer base and in turn drive additional revenues.
Furthermore, the launch of these chips will help NVIDIA cater to the requirement of graphics and design professionals who make films and other video content. As a result of this, the company will be able to fend off competition from AMD, which is expected to launch new graphic chips next year.

The new Turing architecture was named after Alan Turing, who was among the first scientists to predict that advent of artificial intelligence (AI), saying, ""What we want is a machine that can learn from experience.""
While this latest processor exhibits a number of groundbreaking capabilities, ray-tracing (RT) is among the most telling. The technology is a more advanced and lifelike way of generating graphics that re-creates the path that light rays take from their origin to the viewer. While this technique has been widely used in movies and TV shows, it hasn't been practical in video games because the computational demands have been too great to render these images in real time -- until now.
A light at the end of the tunnel
NVIDIA first unveiled RTX -- its new ray-tracing technology -- back in March. Here's how the company described it:
Three new processors will be available beginning in the fourth quarter that boast these new ray-tracing cores, and will use NVIDIA's AI-centric Tensor Cores to accelerate the technology. The Turing-based Quadro GPUs will improve ray-tracing by 25 times compared with its current Pascal architecture, and will retail for prices between $2,300 for the 16 GB version and $10,000 for the high-end 48 GB version. The revenue from these new chips will show up in NVIDIA's professional visualization segment.
While this technology won't be immediately available to the average gamer, a number of well-known companies are already planning to support the new architecture, including Adobe , Disney 's Pixar, and Epic Games -- best known for its breakout battle royale hit Fortnite .
It isn't fun and games -- yet
Gamers won't begin to see the effects of NVIDIA's ray-tracing technology until the publishing companies have had the opportunity to incorporate them into the titles that are currently available. That said, looking down the road six to 12 months might see a whole new era for gamers, and some believe that NVIDIA will announce a consumer-focused version of the technology at its Gamescom conference later this month.
While these Turing GPUs will elevate the quality of the graphics found on video games, there are other applications as well. Just as AI helps improve the rendering of images for games, the same technology can also be used to advance a variety of photo and video applications.
In describing its latest innovations, Huang said, ""The arrival of real-time ray-tracing is the Holy Grail of our industry.""
Keeping the competition at bay
Analysts and investors alike -- myself included -- have long worried that the growing trend of companies seeking to develop their own AI chips might someday result in a processor that proved better for AI than NVIDIA's humble GPU.
This latest release shows that NVIDIA isn't resting on its laurels, waiting around for the competition to eat its lunch. It also demonstrates how the company maintains the lead in an industry it pioneered -- with a consistent and relentless focus on innovation.

Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) has had a rough time in recent months, falling further behind its rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) in total revenue and losing more than 20% of its stock price. But it is possible that the semiconductor maker has hit bottom and is ready for a turnaround.
One big factor depressing the stock's price in recent weeks has been worry about President Trump's trade war with China and other economic rivals. China is a huge market for all computer products, including the memory devices that have formed the heart of Micron's product line.
But China's retaliation for the Trump policies has largely involved agricultural commodities, manufacturing tools and other larger goods. Additionally, most of Micron's revenue stream derives from the United States and Europe, not from the Far East.
In any event, Trump's trade policies have been so erratic that it is hard to forecast exactly what impact they will have on specific industries.

While it is true that Micron stock has lost about one-fifth of its value since peaking three months ago, it is still higher than it was in January. The recent pullback has more to do with analysts recalibrating their overly optimistic forecasts for the company's future growth prospects.
Cloud's Silver Lining
The Idaho-based company has a fairly diversified line of products. It produces a variety of semiconductor devices, including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and solid-state drives. Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix.
Micron and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.
The industry is less cyclical than it used to be. Purchases of personal computers used to fall off during economic declines. But many of today's cloud-computing and AI systems have constant needs for memory updates, which are fixed costs rather than marginal ones.
The company has settled on a strategy of serving the fast-moving cloud-computing market. ""We stand to benefit from the significant investments cloud service providers are making to build out their IT infrastructure,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted during the company's most recent earnings call.
He added that the company is seeing ""strong market demand for memory and fast storage products due to the value these solutions provide in an economy where data - and fast access to that data - is increasingly important.""
Bottom Line on Micron Stock
The stock price has fallen to the point where the company's price-earnings ratio is below 5 - something you certainly don't see in the technology world very often.
Micron Stock Is a Long-Term Winner, But the Near-Term Outlook Is Uncertain
The bottom line is that Micron has suffered various setbacks, but secular trends in the semiconductor market will continue to provide the company with substantial revenue while it readjusts its business model. It is not a sure thing by any means, but investors with a moderate appetite for risk should certainly consider adding Micron stock to their portfolios.

Inspired by more news that China was once again willing to talk productively about trade with the U.S., and inspired by Thursday's bullishness, the buyers kept busy again on Friday. The S&P 500 advanced another 0.33%, with the closer of 2850.13 leaving behind a solid - even if not enormous - gain for the week.
The market's best and worst stocks on Friday were familiar names. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) fell nearly 9% in response to an interview with CEO Elon Musk that could only be categorized as alarmingly odd . Meanwhile Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) gained 2% because investors simply felt like it.
Neither make for particularly great trading setups to start the new week … too much volatility, and too much uncertainty. Rather, it's stock charts of Kroger (NYSE: KR ), Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU ) and Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF ) that offer the most potential. Here's why.
Kroger (KR)
Last year wasn't a great one for Kroger, with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) getting into the business via its acquisition of Whole Foods. It was also a tough one simply because food prices weren't advantageous. KR shareholders suffered, along with owners of most food producer names.

As it turns out though, even with Amazon in the picture, things haven't been as bad for Kroger as first feared. Food prices are getting healthier too. The end result is a recovering stock that has recently broken a key technical ceiling and is ready to test the waters of higher highs.
Click to Enlarge • The buildup for the bullish signal is the convergence of Kroger's trading range in the weekly timeframe, framed by a falling resistance line and a rising support line (white, dashed). The upper boundary was breached three weeks ago, with a healthy second effort.
• As the daily chart indicates, however, KR shares have just bumped into a technical ceiling (yellow, dashed) that has capped the major peaks since June of last year. That suggests a near-term slide is possible, even of the longer-term trend is still bullish thanks to higher lows.
• Working against the budding uptrend is the gap left behind in June. Not all gaps have to absolutely be back-filled, but most are. Either way, there's short-term pressure working against Kroger right now. The question is when and where any selling might slow, stop, and the bulls regroup to make another high. The big line in the sand is still the yellow resistance line.
Intuit (INTU)
There's nothing inherently wrong with Intuit. The stock is uncomfortably expensive, priced at 31 times next year's projected earnings, but it has rallied through tougher valuations.
On the other hand, the market generally only supports frothy valuations for so long before a stock runs out of buyers. When the tide turns, those bulls often turn into bears at a pace similar to their buy-in. INTU is near, if not at, a turning point from an uptrend to a downtrend.
Click to Enlarge • It's subtle, but as of Friday Intuit shares spent a little time under the key support line (red, dashed) that's tagged all the major lows going back to February. Also on Friday the 20-day moving average line (blue) started to slide below the 50-day moving average line (purple) for the first time in months.
• That move follows the first major lower high (dashed, yellow) INTU shares have logged in a long while.
• Zooming out to a weekly chart, it's not difficult to see how ripe this stock is for profit-taking. Intuit is up more than 120% since early 2016, but has become dangerously overextended thanks to the bullish acceleration since late last year. INTU was a whopping 28% above the 200-day moving average line (white) at its peak.
Capital One Financial (COF)
In late July, Capital One Financial was pegged as a budding breakout candidate . At the time, COF shares were working their way out of a downtrend and back into an uptrend. The effort got traction for a couple of days, but petered out before July came to a close.
The underpinnings never really went away though. And, as of last week, the rally appears to have been rekindled … with even a better bullish argument now.
Click to Enlarge • The crux of the bullish thesis is support at a long-standing floor (red, dashed) that's been in place since the big low of 2016. The MACD crossover from late last month is still in place, with COF clearly pushing up and off that line.
• On the daily chart of COF, there's another, more subtle bullish clue … the convergence of all the key moving average lines. Periods of high volatility are follower by period of low volatility, and vice versa. The contraction of the stock's movement should have set up a divergence that - so far anyway - is moving in an upward direction.

Reportedly, the company is eyeing India's food and grocery supermarket chain, More. Notably, More is owned by Kumar Mangalam Birla's Aditya Birla Retail Ltd. (""ABRL"").
An India-based private equity firm, Samara Capital which already has an agreement with ABRL, has approached Amazon and Goldman Sachs to form a special purpose vehicle to acquire More. Amazon is likely to hold 49% of the acquisition vehicle.
We believe the latest move will not only strengthen Amazon's position in India's retail market but also aid its e-commerce market. Additionally, this is likely to aid growth in the company's market share.
Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 61% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry 's rally of 29.2%.
India Holds Promise
Amazon's strong focus toward expansion of its footprint in India with the support of the company's vast e-commerce platform will continue to aid its momentum in the country. Notably, India is witnessing rapid penetration of mobile and internet use at the moment.
According to the report from India Brand Equity Foundation, the Indian retail market is expected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2020 from $680 billion in 2017. This can be attributed to the booming food and grocery retail space in the country.
By 2020, food and grocery retail is anticipated to generate 66% of Indian retail industry's total revenues. This is due to growth of supermarkets and hypermarkets in the country.
Further, online retailing is expected to generate $60 billion by 2020.
We note that Amazon is well poised to reap benefits from this rapidly growing market with the addition of More to its platform.
Currently, ABRL owns 493 supermarkets under its brand More and 20 hypermarkets in the country. Additionally, the company is expanding More stores across the National Capital Regions including major cities of the country - Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai.
However, More enjoys greater market share in the southern part of the country.
Apart from food retail space, Amazon has already forayed into the department store chain space by acquiring 5% in Shoppers Stop last year.

Strengthening Competitive position
Driven by immense growth opportunities in Indian e-commerce space, the country is experiencing increasing investments from the domestic as well as overseas companies.
Amazon's latest move is a significant example of foreign investments. Moreover, it will act as the company's counter strategy against Walmart's WMT entry in India via Flipkart buyout.
We are of the opinion that this development will strengthen Amazon's arsenal in its global food and grocery retail war against Walmart. Notably, it started with Amazon's highly accretive buyout of Whole Foods Market.
Moreover, Amazon's expanding presence in the country poses significant threat to Flipkart's market share in India.
Further, with More, Amazon is likely to gain traction among the traditional Indian buyers who account for a significant share in the total Indian population and are hesitant to shop online owing to issues regarding product quality.
This will aid the company in gaining competitive edge against Reliance Retail and the latest plan of Reliance Industries to develop an e-commerce platform by combining Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm. The platform will be based on online-to-offline (O2O) marketing program.
Moreover, Amazon's aggressive entry in the Indian food and grocery retail space is likely to put significant competitive pressure on the Future Group and Avenue Supermarts' DMart.
Additionally, the company gains a competitive edge against Alibaba BABA which is planning to invest $250-$300 million in online grocer, Bigbasket and is trying to strike deals with Indian giants - Reliance and Tata.
Further, Amazon's growing investment in India does not bode well for eBay's EBAY recent plan to relaunch its Indian division, eBay India.
Currently, Amazon's total investment in its Indian division is pegged at $4 billion with the recent addition of $386 million. Moreover, Amazon has almost 67 warehouses in India.
Currently, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Last week, Alibaba made a move to protect its lead and engender fierce customer loyalty through a new VIP tier for its ""88"" loyalty program (88 in Chinese is pronounced ""Baba""). That 88 program, which offers Alibaba's customers points for both shopping and activities on Alibaba's platforms, was unveiled exactly a year ago in August 2017 for Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall platforms. But the new VIP tier cranks things up a notch, functioning as a super-subscription that extends benefits to a wider array of Alibaba's services beyond the core e-commerce platforms.
The original 88
Last August, Alibaba combined its previous Taobao and Tmall loyalty programs into one program across the company's entire e-commerce universe. For those who don't know, Taobao is the company's consumer-to-consumer platform, sort of like an enhanced and bigger eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) , while the company's Tmall platform is where large brands can sell their wares to Alibaba customers. Previously, each platform had its own loyalty program, where consumers would earn points for transactions. In the combined 88 program, Alibaba extended the ability to gain points via other ""engagement"" activities beyond mere transactions, such as writing reviews or sharing product pages on social media. All that membership data is especially alluring for brands, which gain access to program insights in exchange for becoming exclusive partners.
The 88 benefits include discounts on partner brands or even exclusive products and services (not unlike credit cards' loyalty programs). Members could also find discounts in Alibaba's Tmall supermarket, which takes a page out of Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) playbook for exclusive Whole Foods discounts for Prime members.
Alibaba has several tiers for its members: Standard, Super (1,000+ points), and APASS (2,500+ points), with each tier leading to greater and more luxurious benefits (APASS members would even get access to a digital shopping assistant).
The VIP tier just unveiled, however, takes Alibaba loyalty to the next level.
88 VIP
If you're already a Super user (1,000 or more points), the new VIP subscription upgrade will only cost RMB 88 (which equates to roughly $12.86). For standard users, the subscription will be much more expensive at RMB 888 (which equates to almost $130, even more expensive than the $120 Amazon Prime).
The benefits include not only more discounts at Alibaba platforms and 5% off all groceries at the Tmall supermarket but also enrollment in Alibaba's other subscription services such as video streaming service Youku Tudou and Alibaba's Xiami music streaming service and further discounts on Ele.me for food delivery. Alibaba itself estimates users will average RMB 2,000 in benefits ($292.08), though that will depend on how much stuff one buys.
Keeping it in the family
A lot of what Alibaba has been doing lately -- 88 VIP included -- is focused on keeping customers fenced in to its leading e-commerce platform, which is under threat from JD.com and Pinduoduo, each of which have gained market share over the past few years. Another strategy behind the VIP program seems to be to boost Alibaba's ancillary businesses that do not have leading positions. For instance, Youku Tudou is estimated to be in third place in the Chinese video streaming wars, while Xiami is only the fifth-largest music streaming service just in China.
Alibaba and rival Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) are looking to consolidate much of the Chinese online and offline retail economy -- what they term "" new retail"" -- under their respective corporate umbrellas (Tencent owns minority stakes in JD.com and Pinduoduo). In this battle, 88 and other loyalty programs will become super important. Alibaba is perhaps learning from the phenomenal success of Amazon's Prime program, which provides a similar host of benefits and for which Amazon was able to raise the price earlier this year without much customer churn.
In addition, these subscription programs can be a valuable source of data, which can lead to better products and services, which may put an even greater distance between market leaders and smaller competitors.
Loyalty is everything
Investors in any retail business -- and especially these rising e-commerce platforms -- need to be aware of how they construct their loyalty programs. In a world with more and more options for consumers and new competitive threats popping up every day, they are key tools for retail companies of all shapes, sizes, and geographies.

Excluding Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is arguably one of the most hotly debated stocks on Wall Street. On one side, you have the AMD stock bulls who believe AMD is in the early stages of stealing significant market share from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) in big-time growth verticals, and that as the company gains more market share, AMD will soar.
Source: Shutterstock
On the other side, you have the bear camp. Bears believe that AMD's current rate of market share expansion is unsustainable. Eventually, Intel and Nvidia will punch back, and when they do, AMD stock will drop, according to the bulls.
The bulls have been right thus far. In 2016, this was a $2 stock. In 2017, it was a $10 stock. Now, AMD stock trades around $20.
5 Marijuana Stocks to Watch
But the bears aren't backing down. If anything, they are doubling down. According to YCharts , short interest in AMD (which means the percent of the stock float that is short) is now at 23%. That is up from largely sub-20% levels throughout 2016-17, and it's nearing a decade high.
What does all that mean?
There are two implications. One, AMD stock could rally in the near-term from a potential short squeeze as its quarterly numbers should continue to be quite good. Secondly, AMD could fumble 12 to 18 months down the road when Intel starts punching back.
AMD Stock And the Short Squeeze
Short interest in AMD stock is at nearly 25%. It hasn't been this high since mid-2015. At the time, AMD stock was trading around $2, and a lot of bears were betting that it would go bankrupt.
That didn't happen. Instead, AMD's numbers got better, and all that short interest served as rocket fuel for a huge rally. As the numbers improved, the shorts were rushing to cover, causing a massive short squeeze. Over the next year, short interest dropped from 25% to 12%, and AMD stock rose to $7.
A similar dynamic could play out here and now.
At the moment, AMD is stealing significant market share from Nvidia and Intel. On the Intel front, the market share gains are quite prominent. AMD had less than a 1% share of the server market last year. This year, the company is projected to control somewhere around 7%-9% of the server market. By next year, even Intel is admitting that AMD could have a 15%-20% share of the server market .
AMD's market share expansion won't end any time soon. Intel isn't slated to launch its next-generation chips until late in 2019. Thus, AMD should be able to keep growing its market share and continuing to post above-consensus quarterly numbers for the next several months.
This isn't the first time this has happened. Back in 2004-05, AMD's share of the server market was rising rapidly at Intel's expense, and AMD stock went on a huge run.
Looking at the big picture, I think the AMD narrative will remain largely positive over the next six to twelve months. During that stretch, the company's quarterly numbers will be good, and impatient shorts will rush to cover. The net result should be higher AMD stock prices.
Watch Out for the Long-Term
The shorts aren't entirely wrong here. They are just too early.
There is no doubt that Intel will punch back. It is the 200-pound gorilla in this market, with a 90%-plus share of the server market. They simply aren't going to shrivel up and let AMD walk all over them forever.
When Intel punches back, AMD stock will react. The competitive environment will become more intense, and the era of market share gains and consistent double-beat quarters will come to a close. Investors will start to question the huge premium they are paying for AMD stock, and some money will flow back into INTC stock.
None of this will happen until late 2019. Until then, AMD stock looks good.
But when Intel does punch back in late 2019, AMD stock will take a hit. As such, I think AMD stock is presently a case of near-term gain, long-term pain.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
The huge short interest in AMD stock gives the shares a ton of firepower over the next 12 months as the company's numbers and narrative remain robust.
But in late 2019, Intel will punch back, and AMD stock will likely suffer as a result. Thus, owning AMD stock now and selling it before late 2019 seems like the right strategy.

Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) reports earnings before the bell on Thursday. The Chinese e-commerce giant has struggled to grow its stock over the last year as company spending and fears of a U.S.-China trade war have put a dent in BABA stock. However, stagnation in the stock and investments in company growth have increased interest in Alibaba.
Wall Street predicts consensus earnings-per-share of 74 cents in non-GAAP earnings. If this holds, it would represent a drop from the EPS of 94 cents reported in the same quarter last year. Analysts also expect quarterly revenues to come in at $11.8 billion. This would represent a 62% increase from the year-ago level of $7.29 billion.
Admittedly, falling profits amid rapidly growing revenue appears suspicious. Alibaba has invested heavily in physical infrastructure. For most of its history, the company has more closely resembled eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) in that it acted as the middleman. Today, the company continues to invest in offline shopping. However, allegations of accounting irregularities have also dogged the company. This makes telling the difference between growth and possible fluff difficult.
Trade Issues, Businesses Drive BABA Stock
Trade relations have also weighed on the company. BABA, like peers such as JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ) and Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY ), has struggled as fears of a U.S.-China trade war have sent all Chinese e-commerce stocks reeling in recent months. Alibaba has beaten estimates in three out of the last four quarters. However, Tencent saw its profits fall for the first time in 10 years. JD also missed on earnings estimates. The upcoming report will indicate whether the same trends have affected Alibaba stock.
Safe Investments to Regularly Earn 12%-Plus
Perhaps its competition from the likes of JD and Tencent. Or maybe the message from myself and other InvestorPlace writers that JD is the real ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) of China"" has begun to resonate across the Pacific. Either way, Alibaba has grown to resemble Amazon more.
For this reason, analysts will also look at the growth of Alibaba Cloud. The company recently moved ahead of IBM (NYSE: IBM ) in the market share of the world's cloud market. However, it has not caught up to Amazon or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Still, its dominance of the growing Chinese cloud market could create the conditions necessary to become the world's largest cloud company eventually.
Additionally, its non-core initiatives such as payment processing, artificial intelligence, music delivery and others all contribute to bolstering this conglomerate.
Why BABA Should Grow
I have criticized BABA stock in previous articles regarding its conglomerate status. I still believe that if one wants to invest in multiple businesses, a mutual fund or an ETF paves a safer path toward such diversity. The accounting issues discussed off and on over the years reinforce the need for diversity.
Still, assuming investors can trust the accounting, BABA has begun to look like a more compelling buy. Even under non-GAAP accounting, if predicted profits of $4.73 for the fiscal year hold, the forward price-to-earnings ratio would come to around 37.5. Analysts also predict profit growth for next year of about 38%. Due to accounting issues, I am not ready to recommend the stock. However, if the stock continues to stagnate or fall, BABA could become worth a gamble at a low P/E ratio.
Bottom Line on Alibaba Stock
Alibaba's moves to continue long-term profit growth, as well as recent stock price-related stagnation, appear to change the value proposition on BABA stock.
The earnings report on Thursday should give traders more insight on the state of the company. China's trade relations with the U.S. have also weighed on the stock. While signs continue to point to massive increases in size, accounting issues cast doubts on the extent of this growth. For this reason, I still think BABA stock carries more risk than most investors appreciate. Given that risk, only an ultra-low valuation would compel me to buy BABA stock.

U.S. stock futures are trading mixed this morning. The scandals facing the Donald Trump administration and a tightening monetary policy from the Federal Reserve are shaking things up this morning.
In the release of the latest Fed meeting minutes yesterday, the central bank made no changes to its monetary policy. What's more, there was across the board support for another interest rate hike next month. Wall Street expects to hear more from the Fed after Chairman Jerome Powell gives a speech at the Fed's annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Against this rocky backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures are trading around even. Nasdaq-100 futures are off 0.08%.
In the options pits, volume evaporated once again mid-week. Only about 15.3 million calls and 12.5 million puts changed hands yesterday, putting in the lowest volume session in months. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.90. The 10-day moving average held at 0.63.
Those options traders that decided to participated yesterday centered their focus on tech stocks. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) was a bullish favorite ahead of this morning's quarterly earnings report. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) traders were busy after Citron called for a 20% drop in NVDA stock. Finally, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) saw some rather unusual activity at strikes some 30% north of yesterday's close.
Let's take a closer look:
Alibaba (BABA)
BABA stock is trading nearly 4% higher in premarket activity this morning. Earlier, Alibaba reported a 61% spike in first-quarter revenue , extending a strong string of mid-double-digit-percentage sales growth. Elsewhere, mobile growth remained exceptionally strong, with mobile monthly active users (MAUs) on China retail marketplaces rose to 634 million in June from 617 million in March.
10 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Before They Rally
""The exceptional growth across our major segments of core commerce, cloud computing and digital media and entertainment validates our strategy of investing in customer experience, product, technology and infrastructure for the future,"" said Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu.
Heading into the event, BABA call options were popular in Wednesday's session. Volume topped 520,000 contracts, with calls gobbling up 66% of the day's take. As for weekly Aug 24 options, peak call OI at $180 is set to open in the money. The next most popular strike, the $190 call might fall short of a profit if follow-through buying doesn't kick in tomorrow.
Finally, if you jumped into the BABA Aug 31 $180/$185 bull call spread I recommended a week ago, you're sitting quite nicely this morning. The maximum potential return on that trade was near 190%, with the options expiring next week. Don't be afraid to go ahead and take some profits today if BABA trades above $185.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Citron Research is at it again with NVDA stock. The short-side research firm said that NVDA stock would fall 20% by April 2019, and gave 10 reasons supporting it's projection. However, the bearish note arrived just after Nvidia unveiled its new line of Turing gaming graphics cards. NVDA stock traders sided with the company, as the shares rallied 3.75% yesterday.
NVDA options traders also took the bulls' side. Volume rose to 310,000 contracts yesterday, more than doubling the stock's daily average. Calls claimed 63% of the day's take. That said, options traders remain somewhat cautious of NVDA stock.
Specifically, the September put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.85 - a little on the high side compared the the past year's worth of readings. With NVDA trading near all-time highs, this skepticism is expected and could be healthy if it remains moderate.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
There was a distinct lack of news regarding QCOM stock yesterday. Other than the stock benefitting from a rise in the semiconductor sector, there was nothing out of the ordinary for the shares. That is, until you looked at yesterday options activity.
Overall, about 198,000 contracts traded on QCOM, more than tripling the stock's daily average options volume. Activity was split largely down the middle between puts and calls. Taking a closer look at Trade-Alert.com reveals some rather unusual activity.
Blocks of 24,000 contracts traded on both the Aug 31 $90 put and $90 call strikes. The $90 strike is currently more than 30% above QCOM's trading range near $67. More details indicate that the $90 puts were sold to close and that the $90 calls were brought to close. In other words, this could have been the closure of an in-the-money synthetic short position.
As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Free Lunch is the newest show from Zacks Investment Research. It is streamed live, four times per week, and features breaking news and analysis from Zacks strategists. Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Facebook Live, Twitter, Ustream, and more.
Stocks opened higher on Monday as trade representatives from the U.S. and Mexico neared a deal to resolve certain disagreements on NAFTA. Reforming the trade agreement has been an outspoken focus for President Donald Trump since the election, and now, his administration appears ready to reach an agreement which will focus on the automotive industry.
Also this morning, investors continued to react to the news that Tesla TSLA will, in fact, remain a public company. Polarizing CEO Elon Musk confirmed this plan late Friday, saying that although he had secured funding for a go-private deal, an overwhelming amount of investors had encouraged him to keep the electric car giant public.
Wall Street also witnessed a slight selloff in Chipotle CMG shares as the fast casual Mexican chain was hit with a bearish analyst note this morning. This note, published by Wedbush, argued that near-term concerns related to same-store sales growth and margins could create headwinds for Chipotle as it looks to meet sky-high expectations.
Ryan discusses of these news stories, providing investors with the key facts they need to know and giving his unique perspective on the headlines-all on the first half of today's show.
Later, the host checks in with one of the stock market's hottest momentum plays, AMD AMD . This red-hot chipmaker surged even higher on Monday morning as investors reacted favorably to its new Radeon server card for datacenter visualization, but the stock has been on fire for months for a multitude of reasons.
Ryan explore these reasons, highlighting one key chart that shows exactly how fast AMD has climbed this year-along with its solid earnings growth prospects. He also analyzes the company's current valuation and spotlights its recent earnings estimate trends.
Is AMD really Wall Street's hottest tech stock? What will it take for shares to march even higher? Hear Ryan's answers to these questions, and more, only on today's episode of Free Lunch!

The company's surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average of 4.79%. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.
Coming to share price movement, Semtech's shares have returned 35.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry 's growth of 7.8%.
Why a Likely Positive Surprise?
Our proven model shows that Semtech is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.
Earnings ESP : The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Zacks Rank: Semtech currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 when combined with a positive ESP have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.
The combination of Semtech's favorable Zacks Rank and positive Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.
What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?
The company's improved profitability is driven by differentiated growth drivers and diversification strategy. The key growth drivers for Semtech are product differentiation, operational flexibility, and specific focus on fast-growing segments and regions.
In addition, the growing need for more efficient energy management in home and industrial settings, increasing electronic system requirements for mobile devices, and the propagation of green standards will continue to drive demand in these market segments.
Supported by these factors, we expect the company to report strong results in the quarter to be reported.

Chicago, IL -August 27, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Johnson & JohnsonJNJ , NikeNKE , BPBP , eBayEBAY and BCEBCE .
Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:
Top Research Reports for Johnson & Johnson, Nike and BP
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson, Nike and BP. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
Johnson & Johnson 's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the last three months, gaining +11.2% vs. +10.5%. J&J's sales growth has accelerated since second half of 2017 backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical unit and improving performance in Medical Devices unit.
J&J has already raised its full-year organic sales growth expectations twice this year. Though quite a few key products in J&J's portfolio, like Remicade and Concerta, are facing generic competition, the Zacks analyst believes that new products across segments, successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contributions from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top-line growth.
J&J also enjoys a robust multi-year pipeline of new drugs and line extensions. Meanwhile, share buybacks and restructuring initiatives should provide bottom-line support.
Shares of Nike have gained +14.8% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which gained 12.8% over the same period. The company has delivered positive earnings for over three years now, with fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 marking the 24th straight quarter of earnings beat.
Moreover, sales topped estimates for the fifth straight quarter. Strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on direct-to-customer are the key drivers.
Additionally, continued growth at international and NIKE Direct businesses, as well as the return of the North America business to growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, aided results. Driven by these positives, the company raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2019.
BP 's shares have outperformed the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry over the past year (24.4% vs. 13.6%). The integrated energy company has been gaining on the back of a strong portfolio of upstream projects. Since 2016, BP has placed 16 key upstream projects online, including Atoll Phase 1, Shah Deniz 2 and Taas-Yuryakh oil expansion in Russia.
Such developments continue assisting the British energy giant to boost production by 900 thousand barrel of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/D) by 2021. Moreover, the company has a strong commitment in returning cash back to the shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include eBay and BCE.

If you are holding stock in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) right now, you should consider taking some profits off the table. AMD stock has been on an impressive run during the past month, but the rally has hit extreme levels. As such, a short-term correction is coming … soon.
It's important to keep in mind that this is a short-term correction. AMD has a lot of upside over the long-term. The company has caught market-leader Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) flat footed on cutting-edge semiconductor offerings, and it will take Intel months to catch up. By then, AMD will have stolen more market shares in both the desktop and enterprise/cloud server market.
AMD is also putting pressure on graphics processing giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). AMD's new Radeon Pro V340 graphics card is touted as a direct contender for many applications currently occupied by Nvidia's top-of-the-line offerings. The kicker is that AMD chips come at a considerable price discount for businesses.
So, AMD is a solid long-term buy-and-hold consideration. And there are going to be much better prices to buy in at in a week or so.
The reason lies in AMD stock's recent bump higher. The stock has gained momentum on a series of bullish analyst research notes from the past two weeks and this weekend's Radeon Pro V340 unveiling. This hype has steadily pushed AMD stock higher, ultimately forcing many bearish investors to capitulate.
21 Beverage Stocks to Buy for the Contrarian-Minded
AMD stock short sellers have been hit the hardest. As of the most recent reporting period, some 146 million shares of AMD stock were sold short - about 17.6% of the company's total float. This reading dropped 13% amid a so called ""stealthy short squeeze"" according to the most recent data, contributing to some of AMD's upside.
That short squeeze was no longer stealthy as of Monday, hitting overdrive when AMD stock broke out above $25. What's more, you could almost see the moment when short covering ran out of gas yesterday, when AMD stock rolled over just after topping $27.
Click to Enlarge Technically, AMD's mid-session rollover finally found support at $25 and the shares finished above their session lows. There is still momentum to be had for AMD stock, but the shares are destined to either consolidate or correct lower.
For starters, AMD's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) topped out at 84.43 yesterday. Readings north of 70 are considered overbought, which often means profit taking and a correction are close at hand.
Additionally, AMD appears to be on the backside of a short-term bump-and-run technical formation. The ""bump"" started on Monday last week, when AMD rallied sharply higher and broke out of its former, more measured, uptrend. The ""run"" phase appears to have started at about 1:42 p.m. Eastern on Monday, when the stock peaked at $27.20 and turned sharply lower.
The run phase of this formation could see Advanced Micro fall as low as $20 before profit taking finally dies down. This area is home to round-number psychological support and AMD's 20-day moving average. A pullback to this area would offer up a great buying opportunity for long-term bulls.
That said, there is the potential for $25 to hold as technical support and prevent an all-out run lower for AMD stock. In this scenario, Advanced Micro could be stuck in a consolidation pattern for weeks before overbought conditions finally work their way out.
2 Trades for AMD Stock
Bear Put Spread: Traders looking to bet on a near-term correction in AMD stock might want to consider a Sep $23/$24 bear put spread. At last check, this spread was offered at 33 cents, or $33 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $23.67, while a maximum profit of 67 cents, or $67 per pair of contracts - a potential return of 100% - is possible if AMD stock closes at or below $23 when September options expire.
Put Sell: Traders looking for a more conservative play might consider a Sep $20 put sell position. This put was last bid at 20 cents, or $20 per contract. Traders will keep the premium received as long as AMD holds above $20 through September expiration. However, should AMD trade below $20, you could be assigned 100 shares of AMD stock at $20 each - which, honestly, would be an excellent price for a stock with a lot of long-term upside potential.
As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

U.S. stock futures are trading marginally higher this morning. Wall Street bulls appear to be running low on rally fuel after sending both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to three consecutive record high closes.
As for today's drivers, economic data is in focus this morning. Second-quarter gross domestic product arrived ahead of the open. Also, July pending home sales data is slated for later this morning.
Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added a mere 0.02%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures aren't faring much better, with gains of 0.06% and 0.17%, respectively.
In the options pits, volume drew back considerably in Tuesday's trading. Roughly 15.9 million calls and 12.1 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.53. However, the 10-day moving average fell to a two-month low of 0.59. This may indicate that bullish sentiment is near a short-term peak.
Peak optimism was also noticeable in yesterday's top ten most active options list due to dwindling daily call percentages. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) and General Electric (NYSE: GE ) saw a marked increase in put activity despite a lack of headline news. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) call options volume surged after the company said it completed a portion of it's accelerated share buyback program.
Let's take a closer look:
General Electric (GE)
GE scored the biggest percentage of put volume during yesterday's trading. While there was a distinct lack of headline news, GE has been in the dog house with investors for sometime due to its lack of turnaround progress. The latest concern appears to be the company's power unit, which analysts say has more structural problems than GE wants to admit.
21 Beverage Stocks to Buy for the Contrarian-Minded
On the surface, it appeared that GE options traders loaded up on puts amid growing GE Power concerns. Volume rose to 277,000 contracts, nearly doubling GE's daily average. Puts claimed 72% of that elevated activity.
However, a closer look at the activity via Trade-Alert.com indicates that profit taking may have been the real cause for the spike in put volume. Specifically, a block of nearly 141,000 GE Sep $13 puts (more than half yesterday's volume) crossed late in the session at the bid price. Implied volatility at the strike declined and open interest fell, indicating that these contracts were sold to close.
With GE bouncing off it's Aug. 15 lows and closing in on $13 once again, this may have been a trader locking in profits on a bearish put position on GE.
Qualcomm (QCOM)
QCOM stock was among the bigger winners in the tech sector yesterday. The shares rose roughly 2.6% on news that Qualcomm is buying back 76.2 million shares in a $1 billion tender offer. The move marks the first step in the company's accelerated stock buyback plan that was approved after it's buyout of NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI ) fell through.
QCOM options volume rose to 174,000 contracts as a result, with calls gobbling up 80% of the day's take. No major block trades or single strike activity stood out on the session, indicating that the activity was likely not driven by institutional activity - which is odd considering that buybacks can drive arbitrage plays.
Looking out to September, the put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.6. In other words, calls are on the verge of doubling puts for the front-month series. QCOM stock has seen a slow grind higher in optimism and call activity following the failure of the NXP deal.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
AMD stock fell nearly 1% yesterday, extending a sharp sell off that began at about midday on Monday. The sell off is threatening key support at $25 for AMD, which had ridden a extreme wave of bullish sentiment in the prior week.
While the stock remains a solid long-term buy, it appears that AMD bulls will get better entry prices as this recent rally consolidates. In premarket activity, AMD is down another 1.36% at last check.
Options traders even grew a bit cautious, as yesterday's volume lacked AMD's typical call option bias. Some 876,000 contracts traded on AMD yesterday, with calls only making up 59% of the overall activity.
Trade-Alert.com data reveals that the weekly Aug. 31 $26 and $25 call strikes were the most popular. The majority of $26 calls crossed at the bid, while the $25 calls traded nearer the ask.
The Aug. 31 $24 puts also received considerable attention, with most of this activity trading nearer the bid price, suggesting near-term premium selling in the hopes that AMD will hold above $24 through Friday's close.
As of this writing, Joseph Hargett held no position in any of the aforementioned equities.

Notably, the recipients include several developers who are building tools and plugins on Adobe XD for the benefit of the designers.
The recipients include the likes of CloudApp, Stark, Design+Code, Modulz, UI Faces, to name a few.
Furthermore, Adobe is already in working with Microsoft MSFT , Alphabet's GOOGL Google Cloud, Trello, Astute Graphics, Airtable and many more to create plugins on Adobe XD.
All these will enhance the designing experience globally. Consequently, this is likely to expand the customer base of Adobe by attracting more developers to its platform, driving its top-line growth.

Best Electric Car Stock? You'll Never Guess It.
Zacks Research has released a report that may shock many investors. One stock stands out as the best way to invest in the surge to electric cars. And it's not the one you may think!
Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium battery power is set to shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, revenues that were already at $31 billion in 2016 are expected to blast to over $67 billion by the end of 2022.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is Wall Street's newest darling.
At the start of 2016, this was a $2 stock. On Aug. 28, AMD stock traded as high as $25 per share.
I was high on AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su when she took over in 2014 . I called AMD stock a buy and have not been disappointed.
But never fall in love with a stock. Always be ready to reevaluate.
AMD's rise illustrates the shift in power from chip manufacturers to chip designers. All the best chip companies are now ""fab-less,"" from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) to Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) to AMD.
7 Reasons Trump's Impeachment Won't Crash the Stock Market
Moore's Law is the idea that chip density can double every year or two, at no increase in cost. It was first promulgated by Gordon Moore, later co-founder of Intel, in Electronics Magazine . Moore's Law lets chip designers get more value from their designs every year, once they go into production.
But there's a corollary to Moore's Law, which I call Moore's Second Law. That is, as chip densities increase and as the distance between circuit lines, measured in nanometers (nm), continues to go down, the cost of the machines that make them also grows exponentially.
This is why AMD is switching foundries , from privately held Global Foundries to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ). Global has decided not to develop the 7 nm process required for AMD's latest designs.
A Possible Tipping Point
I think this means a tipping point has been reached.
Global Foundries claims there is no demand for 7 nm product right now, but the fact is it's just very hard, and very expensive, to make chips with lines so close together. Moore's Law, traditionally defined in terms of circuit lines on silicon, is hitting a wall.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) says it won't even have 10 nm production until next year. The company is hiring AMD executives as fast as it can .
AMD, in short, has no choice when it comes to foundries. TSM, which is in what China's government calls ""Greater China,"" is the only company that can make AMD's next chips to its specifications. China, in other words, has a near-term monopoly on 7 nm technology.
Monopolists don't have to compete on price. Monopolists can get any price they want. Do you think this has occurred to the good people at Taiwan Semiconductor?
I think it has.
Wall Street Continues to Miss It
This news has not, however, gotten through to the good people on Wall Street.
Analysts are pounding the table for AMD . Their price targets can't seem to keep up with their buy orders. The price-to-earnings ratio of AMD stock is now nearly double that of Nvidia, but price no longer seems to matter .
After all, they think, if Intel chips at 14 nm have to compete directly with AMD chips at 7 nm, doesn't that give AMD the premium price ?
Meanwhile, the price of shares in companies whose equipment makes chips, like Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ), are rolling over.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
Business reporters are saying that AMD is winning the chip war over Intel , but to me, something's not right. AMD has a design for 7 nm chips, but only Taiwan Semiconductor can make them. Doesn't that mean Taiwan Semiconductor is winning the war?
Taiwan Semiconductor currently has a market cap of $217 billion. That's just $7 billion less than Intel. Its price-to-earnings ratio is a reasonable 19.5, and its dividend yields 3.3% at its Aug. 29 opening price of about $43.70 per share. Intel's dividend yield is lower, at 2.5%.
A Correction Is Coming for Advanced Micro Devices -- Take Profits Now
Considering Moore's Second Law, and Taiwan Semiconductor's lead on Intel in 7 nm technology, doesn't that make TSM, rather than AMD, the name to play?

Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 45.1%.
In the last reported quarter, the company delivered non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. The figure also improved 13.8% year over year.
Strong growth can primarily be attributed to 28.9% jump in revenues, which totaled $618.6 million. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $609 million. The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.
What to Expect
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 26 cents, up 8.3% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $663.1 million, up roughly 26.2% from the year-ago quarter.
Workday's shares have gained 51.2% on a year to date basis, substantially outperforming the industry's rally of 27.4%.
Factors Likely to Impact Q2 Results
Workday extended capabilities and tools in Workday HCM with new customer experience.
Workday has more than 2,200 customers. During the last reported quarter, the company added Inter IKEA Services, Great Lakes, Tyson Shared Services and Unisys Corporation as its new HCM customers. The clientele now includes two Fortune 500 customers, one of which is a Fortune 100 company. Some other new financial management customers include Sprouts Farmers Market, Rivera and Race Truck Petroleum, one of the largest private companies in the United States.
Further, Aon, an HCM customer in 2013, became live on financial management in 28 countries, including Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and the United States.
The company announced the availability of new data discovery capabilities in Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Cloud Platform, the first offering delivered on Workday Data-as-a-Service, during the quarter under review.
Workday was placed in the Leaders quadrant of ""Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises"" by Gartner.
Workday announced partnership with Slack to aid customers in completing tasks more efficiently and effectively by engaging with Workday from within the Slack interface. This will enhance security and improve functionality of Workday's user interface.
The company also signed an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Adaptive Insights. The purchase is likely to aid Workday pursue its goal of emerging as an industry leader in better business decisions, operational expertise and evolve as a provider of enterprise-level software solutions for financial management as well as human resource domains. Together with Adaptive Insight, Workday aims to better plan, execute and help organizations to drive their financial and business changes.
Workday also partnered Duo Security and SkipFlag. We believe improving customer satisfaction rate and recent buyouts bodes well for the company's growth in the near term.
However, intensifying competition from peers and higher marketing expenditure are major headwinds in the near term.

2018-09-04,AMD,28.059999465942383,28.11000061035156,25.56999969482422,25.6200008392334,192541300.0,1.0,2.187252786936842,27.50904726870659,16.193952609223096,79.13539434738578,196.05651454040245,70.52841241822172,20.65,18.36816670099894,13.15999984741211,127.19088983958736,4.0,1.6554850407978239,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD saw its stock price soar over 11% on Tuesday on the back of more positive analyst notes, which have pointed to the chip maker's ability to grab market share from its rival Intel INTC . The question is: should investors consider buying AMD stock after it hit another new 52-week high?
The Upgrades & What's Behind Them
Jefferies analysts reiterated their ""buy"" rating for AMD stock and raised their price target from $22 to $30 per share on Monday. ""We see this as a foundational shift in competitive dynamics,"" Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note to clients. ""Meanwhile, our checks also suggest that AMD continues to take share in high-end notebooks.""
Lipacis also said that he expects AMD to capture 12% of the server chip market in 2019, up from 8% in 2018. This growth projection stems from the fact that AMD is projected to have its 7-nanometer chips launch long before Intel rolls out it 10-nanometer chips, which are now expected to debut in late 2019.
Investors should note that one nanometer is equal to one-billionth of a meter, with the idea being that smaller nanometer chips are often more powerful. Jefferies said that the next year and a half will mark the first time in a while that AMD offers a chip with higher transistor density than Intel.
Along with Jefferies, Cowen on Monday lifted its AMD price target from $25 to $30 per share. The firm also reaffirmed its ""outperform"" rating, offering similar competitive advantage-based reasoning. Plus, last week analysts at Rosenblatt Securities raised their price target for shares of AMD from $27 to $30. Rosenblatt based its new AMD price target on the firm's current advantages over Intel as well as Nvidia NVDA .
Shares of AMD surged over 11.5% on Tuesday to touch a new 52-week high of $28.11 per share. This new year-long high also marked AMD's highest price point since 2006.
Price Movement & Valuation
Tuesday's surge is part of an insane run for the company. AMD has seen its stock price skyrocket 1,442% over the last three years, from under $2 per share in August of 2015. This growth crushes the likes of Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL . Shares of AMD did go through a slow stretch during this time period, but have returned to impressive growth recently. AMD stock was up over 135% before Tuesday's gains over the last six months, which crushes the S&P 500's 7% jump and its industry's 2.4% pop.
Moving on, AMD is currently trading at 50.9X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks an insane premium compared to the S&P's 17.6X and its industry's 12.1X average. Worse still, AMD stock has traded as low as 26X over the last year, with a one-year median of 39.6X. Therefore, AMD's current valuation picture appears very stretched compared to where it has traded over the last year.
Outlook
Looking ahead, AMD's quarterly revenues are projected to pop by just under 4% to reach $1.71 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. For the full year, AMD's top line is expected to hit $6.69 billion, which would mark a much more impressive 25.5% surge.
At the other end of the income statement, the firm is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings jump by 20% to reach $0.12 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is projected to skyrocket 176%.
Bottom Line
AMD's full-year growth projections appear rather impressive. However, shares of AMD have gone on a mind-blowing run over the last three years. Plus, AMD's earnings revision activity has been relatively mixed over the last 60 days, which helps AMD land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Therefore, investors might want to keep an eye on AMD stock for now and maybe wait for it to cool down a bit.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.
It's not the one you think.

Recently, Amazon introduced a version of its online shopping website and application for mobile in Hindi - India's most widely used language - to make shopping more convinient.
Moreover, the latest move will enable the company to bridge the language barrier that exists in the country. With the latest development, Amazon will be able to penetrate the villages and small town areas where a significant portion of the Indian population resides.
This bodes well for its strong focus to address the next 100 million customers in the country, per Reuters.
All these will help the company to rapidly penetrate in the Indian e-commerce market where it already holds a significant position. Further, the company's presence in the country's retail space will also be strengthened.
Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 72.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry 's rally of 35.3%.
India Holds Promise
Notably, India is witnessing rapid penetration of mobile and Internet use at the moment.
Per the latest data from eMarketer, the sales figure in the e-commerce market of India is expected to reach $72 billion by 2022 from $32.7 billion in 2018.
According to the report from India Brand Equity Foundation, online shopping in the country is expected to reach $135.8 billion in 2018, surging 31% on a year-over-year basis.
Further, the report suggests that the Indian retail market is expected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2020 from $680 billion in 2017.
We note that Amazon is well poised to reap benefits from this rapidly growing market with its latest local language initiative.

Amazon in India
Amazon's continuous efforts to strengthen its business in India will continue to benefit the company in sustaining momentum in the market. Amazon's e-commerce platform has been a big success in India and will continue to boost its top-line growth.
The company is likely to continue with its push into the country's e-commerce market, making the nation its fifth largest market after the United States, the U.K., Japan and Germany.
Recently, Amazon has been approached by Samara Capital to form a special purpose vehicle along with the cooperation from Goldman Sachs to acquire Aditya Birla Retail owned More. This will boost its market share in the grocery retail market of India.
Further, the company has already forayed into the department store chain space by acquiring 5% in Shoppers Stop last year.
We believe Amazon's expanding presence in the country will help it in gaining competitive edge against Walmart WMT which owns majority of Flipkart. Notably, this poses a significant threat to Flipkart's market share.
Further, Amazon's growing investment in India does not bode well for eBay's EBAY recent plan to relaunch its Indian division, eBay India.
In terms of local language, neither Flipkart nor its subsidiaries, Myntra and Jabong have a local language application yet. In fact, Snapdeal and Alibaba BABA backed Paytm Mall also does not possess a local language version of their online portals.
Meanwhile, apart from the latest Hindi version of Amazon.in, the company is aggressively planning to bring more Indian local languages to its mobile website and app.
All these endeavors of Amazon will continue to boost its market share in India.
Currently, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Recently, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has become one of my least-favorite investments to discuss. For starters, everyone wants to talk about Amazon stock, which is great for the first thousand go-arounds. But now, I feel like a one-hit wonder asked to play that song one more time.
Plus, I'm not sure what else I can add to the discussion. Whether you want to admit it or not, Amazon.com is the greatest company on earth. No one, not Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), not Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), not even trillion-dollar Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) can dethrone Jeff Bezos' house.
So I'm often left to reiterate the obvious: Amazon.com will take over the world. By logical deduction, you'll want exposure to Amazon stock, if you can afford it.
But in searching for any new angles for this all-angles-covered company, I realized something: we are grossly underestimating AMZN stock.
You read that correctly. The e-commerce giant, which has disrupted almost every single brick-and-mortar retailer, and is stridently pushing into new sectors, is undervalued.
Trump Supreme Court Creates Legal Sports Betting Investment Bonanza
I'm not just talking about the company's own push to a $1-trillion market capitalization. At time of writing, the equity value stands just shy of $995 billion. Amazon stock merely needs to sneeze in the right direction, and the resultant momentum will swing it above the benchmark.
Nor am I talking about which one of the two stalwarts will hit $2 trillion first . Of course the answer is AMZN stock! As our own James Brumley noted, if Amazon.com was the only website in the world, you could practically satisfy all your demands through its platform.
No, what I mean is that Amazon stock is criminally underrated. Unless Amazon splits shares, each unit's price point could become the equivalent of an entry-level sedan.
Amazon Stock on the Cusp of Demographic Greatness
The first clue that we're not really appreciating Amazon.com's true potential is its average customer age . At approximately 38 years, the company currently sells to ""halfway"" consumers.
By this term, I'm referring to the fact that this demographic enjoys both digital purchases as well as traditional ones. The reason is simple. We're creatures of habit. Older millennials and Generation X grew up in an analog era, but matured into adulthood during the internet age. They enjoy the conveniences that digitalization offers, but they're not fully vested.
Generation Z, on the other hand, knows no other way but the digital route. For instance, according to the Pew Research Center, only 14% of American adults had internet access in 1995. But nearly two decades later, that figure jumped to 87% .
While we marvel at the latest gizmos and gadgets for their functionality and convenience factors, Gen Z accepts these technologies as a given. The only equivalent I can think of is this: When we flip the switch, we expect the lights to turn on. We never marvel at the miracle of electrical engineering.
Therefore, when Gen Z comes of age and enters their prime earning years, AMZN stock will receive another bullish cycle. For the first time in history, a digital company and a natively digital consumer base will merge.
Obviously, this dynamic benefits all consumer-electronics companies. But only Amazon stock represents the go-to hub for all things. Hence, Jeff Bezos' evil genius. His aggressive inroads into seemingly disparate industries followed a demographic masterplan.
By acquiring Whole Foods Market, Bezos will dictate how Gen Z buys groceries. Amazon's presence in the cloud will influence tomorrow's work culture. Finally, its healthcare campaign reflects the company's desire to impose a cradle-to-grave hegemony.
AMZN Stock Stands Alone
For many of you, this is a scary thought. But the reality is that no one can stop this train.
Practically speaking, Amazon stock enjoys an uncontested monopoly. Sure, President Trump is unhappy about Amazon.com, but even he is helpless in this matter.
I'd bet anything that Trump himself probably shops on the e-commerce platform whenever he has a free moment. Which is to say that Amazon is e-commerce. Instinctively, we know this because if its website ever went down permanently, we'd all panic.
If you're still not convinced that AMZN stock is severely undervalued, consider that with our currently mixed demographic, the underlying company will take nearly half of all U.S. e-commerce sales this year.
The second-most dominant e-commerce player is eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), which will take less than 7%. Big-box retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) for all its huffing and puffing in e-commerce will bring home only 3.7%.
3 Ways Amazon Stock Can Keep the Growth Coming
Already, Amazon has entered loony-tunes territory. But what will happen when Gen Z asserts its earnings power? That reality is only a few years away, which means we'll soon see absolutely crazy valuations for AMZN stock.
As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Wednesday was a rocky session for U.S. equities, as declines in tech weighed on overall sentiment. It's unclear if this is simply a hiccup at this point, or the start of a larger correction in September. In either regard, let's look at some of the top stock trades that played a role on Wednesday.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: JD.com (JD)
Shares of JD.com (NASDAQ: JD ) sank more than 10%, adding to its already catastrophic losses over the past few months. Recent reports over its CEO haven't painted a very good picture.
But what type of picture does the chart paint? Really bad.
As shown above, on a weekly basis, JD stock has never been this oversold. Perhaps it will lead to a sharp rebound in the share price, as prior overbought conditions highlight (via blue circles).
We have played support No. 1 numerous times this year, but using levels and discipline is very important. Once support No. 1 gave way, we waited to see how support No. 2 would hold up. It didn't. Now it's not clear where JD will go.
Trump Supreme Court Creates Legal Sports Betting Investment Bonanza
Buying now is akin to catching a falling knife. Let's see how and when it stabilizes, and whether it's heading for the $22 to $23 range first.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has been the complete opposite, rallying like mad over the past few months. If you missed the move below $10 and once again below $20, there's no reason to chase it now just below $30.
Admittedly, we took our long position off far too early in hindsight, but we still got to feast on AMD stock.
The stock has an unsustainable RSI (blue circle). However, AMD's current rally has had a tendency to move up, consolidate (blue rectangles) and rally again. Let's see how it consolidates going forward.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Apple (AAPL)
Like AMD stock, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) also has a high RSI. This morning, the reading stood at 86, a rather high number for a $1 trillion market cap company. The RSI isn't our only consideration, but it is one input in the equation. Long-term investors probably won't consider taking profits and that's just fine.
But we can probably buy this one, reasonably, on a pullback down to $220. Keep in mind its 50-day moving average is all the way down at $201. We have been a big-time bull on Apple stock, but this move has been too much, too fast. Plus, there's no telling what it will do ahead of its iPhone event on Sept. 12. It feels like it has already rallied ahead. Maybe now it dips, or perhaps it heads higher. We don't know yet, but we will find out soon enough.
21 Beverage Stocks to Buy for the Contrarian-Minded
I would love a drop down toward $200 to $210. Plenty of support would come into play down there, although it's not clear a decline of that magnitude will surface.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Tilray (TLRY)
Pot stocks are so lit!
Wow, I'm sorry I couldn't help the pun, especially because it's true. Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY ) has gone from an opening-day low of $20 back in July to a high of $97 Wednesday, after TLRY stock's 23% rally.
The market cap is closing in on $10 billion, as the rally has been nothing short of insane.
But investors will have plenty of regret if they buy in now. Expectations only call for sales of $41 million this year, and $153 million next year. While that's incredible growth, TLRY trades at a laughable 225 times this year's sales and almost 60 times next year's sales.
Heck, the eight-day moving average is $30 below current levels, while the RSI sits all the way up at 90. This is a classic no-touch.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow: Home Depot (HD)
Let's keep it simple with Home Depot (NYSE: HD ). HD is a great company, it has great fundamentals and now, it has a great stock chart.

With a breakout over this $202.50 level, HD stock is a buy. Below that level, investors can chalk up their minor losses and hawk a new entry. But over that mark, and it's a long.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Shares have added about 0.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Monster Beverage due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.
Monster Beverage Q2 Earnings Top, Sales Lag Estimates

Monster Beverage posted mixed second-quarter 2018 results, wherein the bottom line beat estimates while the top line missed. Both earnings and sales improved on a year-over-year basis.

Q2 Highlights

Monster Beverage's earnings came in at 48 cents per share, up 23.8% year over year and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.

Net sales of $1,015.9 million increased 12% year over year but missed the consensus mark of $1,034 million. Foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by $16.8 million, partly offset by $12.2 million adverse impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606. Excluding the adoption of ASC 606, the top line grew 13.3% in the quarter.

Outside the United States, net sales to customers totaled $293.8 million, up 18.5% year over year.

Quarterly Segment Details

Monster Energy Drinks: Net sales at the segment, which includes Monster Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, were up 14% from the year-ago quarter to $929.4 million. The metric was somewhat hurt by $5.1 million owing to the adoption of ASC 606.

Strategic Brands: This segment includes a range of energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO - Research Report). Net sales at the segment declined 6.8% to $79.8 million in the quarter. The downside was mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606.

Other: Net sales at the segment, which includes some products of American Fruits & Flavors sold to independent third parties, dipped 6.5% year over year to $6.6 million.

Costs & Margins

Second-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) to 61.1%. The decline can be attributed to higher promotional allowances, the adoption of ASC 606, higher input costs as well as geographical and domestic product sales mix.

Operating expenses, including $5.5 million of distributor termination expenses, increased 12.5% from the prior-year quarter to $262.6 million. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, totaled 11.4%, down 120 bps from second-quarter 2017.

Operating income was $357.6 million, up 2.2% year over year. However, operating margin contracted 340 bps to 35.2%.

Other Financials

Monster Beverage ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $659.7 million and total stockholders' equity of $3,605.2 million.

Effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.6% compared with 35.9% in the prior-year quarter.

Moreover, the company bought back roughly 10.6 million shares worth $553.2 million, excluding broker commissions. It had an outstanding authorization to buy back shares worth nearly $196.7 million under its May 2018 repurchase plan as of Aug 7, 2018. Additionally, management announced a new $500-million share repurchase program on Aug 7, 2018.

Looking Ahead

Management remains encouraged with the company's quarterly results and is smoothly progressing with the strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers. Notably, it has launched Monster Energy brand with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Belarus, Tanzania and Uruguay besides re-launching the brand with a Coca-Cola bottler in certain cities across India. It plans for more international launches later in 2018.

Also, Monster Beverage is optimistic about product launches and robust performance in its international markets.
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?
In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.
VGM Scores
At this time, Monster Beverage has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Outlook
Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Monster Beverage has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

Semiconductor stocks are rolling over … again.
The Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA: SMH ), which I called my favorite exchange-traded fund as recently as June , has plunged this month, from $109.73 on Labor Day to $106.30 as trade opened Sept. 7.
This is the fifth fall of the year for the index, which also fell hard in August, June, March and February. So far in 2017, however, it's still up 4.3%.
That's not terrible, but what analysts are calling a ""chip plunge"" is really a recent preference for consumer discretionary stocks. The Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA: VCR ) is up 12.6% for the year, with most holdings in retailers and entertainment companies.
A balanced portfolio would have both these names, but it's the performance of individual semiconductor stocks that has drawn the attention.
Semiconductor Stocks: Up Is Down
Companies that make the gear to make chips, like KLA Tencor (NASDAQ: KLAC ), are down 8% since Aug. 31. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), which have been leading the sector this year, are both down for the week.
Most worryingly, Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) is down over 15%, in just five trading sessions. At its Sept. 7 opening bid of $45.05, it was trading at just 4.5 times earnings, and its market cap of $51 billion is barely 2.5 times its 2017 sales of $20.3 billion.
Your Chance to Cash In With Legal Sports Betting
The fall has accelerated as Micron admitted that prices on ""flash memory"" chips, known as NAND, fell during its most recent quarter, with Morgan Stanley saying Micron inventories are growing, and prices are deteriorating.
There's nothing unusual about this. Memory prices are volatile, they're commodities and as supply catches up with demand, prices fall. Micron had room to fall because its most recent quarters have been monsters , as demand from both cloud and device companies remained strong.
This decade has seen a secular change in memory, as chips are now preferred over disks for their durability, energy efficiency and faster response. The price difference between chips and disk memory have fallen to the point of irrelevance, so these advances have come to the fore. Even PCs aren't shipping with hard drives anymore.
What's Next
The main drivers of chip sales, however, remain the Cloud Czars. If they begin slowing their capital expenditures, semiconductor stocks will roll over. But there is no indication this is happening. Capital spending on cloud data centers was up 59% year-over-year in the second quarter , exceeding $25 billion.
If there is something to worry about, it is that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is pacing that growth , that its margins are falling as a result and that the social media space as a whole has rolled over, meaning there could be excess cloud capacity down the road.
Things are just going so well that anything less than great looks bad. We were at a market peak, so profit-taking and weakness should be expected.
The Bottom Line on Semiconductor Stocks
If you're to see the present pause in chip stock prices as anything but a buying opportunity, you believe we're entering a technology recession and that economic growth is about to slow dramatically.
What's happening is that the social media crisis, the China trade ""war,"" and a global growth slowdown are making semiconductor stocks the ""canary in the coal mine"" for investors, since the use of chips in clouds and devices keep deflation and growth going.
Growth may pause. A recession may come. But chip makers have been expecting this.
Micron had $5.1 billion in cash on its books at the end of August, Nvidia $7 billion, while KLA Tencor had cash and securities worth $3 billion on its books in June. They're ready for anything that comes.
If it comes … when it comes, buy with both hands, because they will come back. Not all the consumer discretionary stocks can say that.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Reportedly, Infosys will own 60% of the joint venture while Temasek will hold the rest. The joint venture will be headquartered in Singapore with Infosys' vice president and regional head in Southeast Asia, Shveta Arora, serving as CEO.
As part of it, operations and the team of Trusted Source Pte Ltd, Temasek's wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore, will be integrated. Some of Infosys's employees will also be included eventually.
Win-Win Scenario for Both
Infosys and Temasek both stand to benefit from this alliance. While Temasek looks to enhance its IT services, Infosys is expected to boost workforce capacity. Infosys has been focusing on enhancing the skills of its employees for quite some time now.
Infosys has also been looking to expand its presence in the regions it operates so as to help clients in business transformation. Per Infosys president, Mohit Joshi, ""Infosys will leverage its digital skills, learning capabilities and transformation experience to help enhance operations across Temasek's global business.""
On the other hand, Temasek's CTO Jon Allaway was quoted saying, ""The partnership will also help unlock new capabilities and technology platforms that help Temasek as the organization continues our growth as a Singapore-headquartered investor, with a global presence.""

PayPal's latest move helps it better compete in a crowded digital payment industry. The question for investors is should they consider buying PYPL stock at the moment?
Funds Now
PayPal announced Tuesday its new Funds Now feature allows the firm's business clients to receive instant payouts on transactions. The digital payment firm said that it has started to roll out Funds Now to select business clients and sellers to give them access to money within second of many transactions. PayPal said its latest offering won't cost its business customers any more money.
The hope is that Funds Now will attract more business clients to PayPal and encourage its current business partners, of which it boasts 17 million, to stay. PayPal said that it plans to eventually introduce this offering globally after its pilot program. ""It's our commitment to helping you get your money faster and helping make sure that nothing gets in your way when you get paid,"" the firm wrote in a company statement.
Investors should note that PayPal's move comes nearly two years after digital payment rival Stripe launched its instant payout feature. Stripe is a mobile commerce firm that currently boasts clients from Lyft and Instacart to giants such as Target TGT .
Overview
PayPal, which spun off from eBay EBAY in 2015, currently claims 244 million active account holders from 200 markets. These clients also include its peer-to-peer payment app Venmo, among other offerings. The firm has also made some acquisitions this year, which include its June purchase of Hyperwallet for roughly $400 million to help it expand its global payout capabilities. PayPal acquired fraud prevention and risk management firm Simility for $120 million in cash that same month.
These purchases followed the firm's $2.2 billion May acquisition of small business commerce platform iZettle, which operates mostly in Europe and Latin America. Venmo has also landed partnerships with Uber and Grubhub GRUB in its battle with Square's SQ Cash App, JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) QuickPay-and don't forget about Apple AAPL and Google GOOGL Pay.
PayPal also recently announced that it redesigned its mobile app to help the firm get back to its core payment roots. ""We are making the app simpler to use and making it even easier for our customers to send and request money,"" PayPal wrote in a statement.
Stock Performance
Investors will see that shares of PYPL have soared since the company spilt from eBay. Shares of PayPal have skyrocketed over 135% during the last two years, which outpaces its industry's 44% climb and the S&P 500's 34% gain. PYPL's stock price is up roughly 13% over the last six months and currently sits a few dollars below its 52-week high of $93.44 per share.
Outlook
Looking ahead, PayPal's Q3 revenues are projected to jump by 13.2% to hit $3.67 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. PYPL's fiscal year revenues are expected to reach $15.47 billion, which would mark over an 18% climb.
Investors might be even more pleased with PayPal's bottom line growth projections. The firm's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by over 17.4% to hit $0.54 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 23%. PayPal has also earned 14 upward earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2018 over the last 60 days, against just one downward change. However, the company's earnings revision activity for the current quarter and fiscal 2019 has been mixed.
Bottom Line
PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its recent earnings estimate revision trends. The firm also looks poised to continue to expand both its top and bottom lines in the quickly expanding digital and mobile payment economy. With that said, PayPal is trading at 43.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry's 32.8X average and the S&P's 17.4X.
Therefore, it might be best to wait for PayPal stock to cool off a bit and consider scooping PYPL up below its current price point.

PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its recent earnings estimate revision trends. The firm also looks poised to continue to expand both its top and bottom lines in the quickly expanding digital and mobile payment economy. With that said, PayPal is trading at 43.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a significant premium compared to its industry's 32.8X average and the S&P's 17.4X.
Therefore, it might be best to wait for PayPal stock to cool off a bit and consider scooping PYPL up below its current price point.

U.S. stock futures are trading broadly lower this morning. Wall Street has finally shaken off it's Monday haze and realized that there are serious trade concerns to look at.
Specifically, President Donald Trump's warning that another $267 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods could follow on the heels of a promised $200 billion in tariffs already in the works. China has said it will retaliate in kind to any tariffs.
Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have fallen 0.47%, with S&P 500 futures down 0.31%. Nasdaq-100 futures are also in the dumps, down 0.43%.
In the options pits, volume evaporated as options traders held their ground on Monday. Overall, only about 14.6 million calls and 11.1 million puts changed hands on the session for the lowest daily total in months. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio fell to 0.62, hitting a one-week low. The 10-day moving average ticked higher t0 0.61 - a three-week high.
Options traders zeroed in on reports that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) continues to gain market share in in desktops and laptops. Elsewhere, energy companies were all the rage. Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (NYSE: PBR ) options rose on lower debt projections, and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK ) rose despite falling natural gas prices.
Let's take a closer look:
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)
Susquehanna offered praise for Advanced Micro Devices yesterday. Despite maintaining a ""neutral"" rating, the ratings firm said AMD is gaining market share in desktops and laptops due to growth in Ryzen Mobile. Susquehanna said that ""most data points for AMD were constructive.""
7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid This Tough Market Environment
Options traders have needed little urging lately to load up on AMD positions. Yesterday, volume spiked to 652,000 contracts following Susquehanna's remarks. Calls claimed an impressive 71% of the day's take.
That said, there is evidence that much of the recent call activity on AMD is profit taking. For instance, the October put/call open interest ratio has risen in the past week to 1.13. In layman's terms, puts are more popular than calls in October, indicating expectations for a potential reversal in AMD stock.
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (PBR)
Brazilian state-owned oil company Petrobras is improving its balance sheet . Yesterday, the company cut its 2018 net debt target to $69 billion from $85 billion last year. Petrobras also said it expects free cash flow to rise to $15 billion this year from $13.9 billion in 2017.
Options traders appeared to react to the news. Volume spiked to 204,000 contracts, or more than double PBR's daily average. Calls claimed a whopping 91% of the day's activity.
Taking a closer look at that call activity on Trade-Alert.com reveals that most of this activity took place at the January 2019 $11 and $14 strike calls. Blocks totaling roughly 60,000 contracts traded on both January strikes, both at the mid price, making it hard to tell the trader's intentions.
Open interest at the January 2019 $11 call currently stands at 118,000 contracts, with about 96,000 contracts open at the January 2019 $14 call.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK)
Natural gas prices fell sharply yesterday, but Chesapeake Energy stock defied the price action of its main commodity. The U.S. Energy Department said that weekly inventories rose more than expected . Combined with weather predictions and continued strong production, natural gas shed 4.8% last week.
Still, CHK stock rose more than 1.2% yesterday. The shares are trading near oversold levels and support at their 200-day moving averages. In other words, bargain hunting appears to be outweighing short-term weakness in natural gas prices.
Options traders were call heavy yesterday. Volume topped 186,000 contracts, coming in at about 5.7 times CHK's daily average.
As with PBR, the majority of this activity came from one set of trades. At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, two blocks of January 2020 $7 calls totaling about 80,000 contracts and 62,000 contracts traded at the bid price. In other words, one or two traders sold thousands of January 2020 $7 strike calls on CHK.
The bid at the time of the trades was 36 cents, or $36 per contract, putting the total for both transactions at more than $5.1 million - a rather sizeable bet that CHK will remain below $7 for the next two years.
As of this writing, Joseph Hargett held no position in any of the aforementioned equities.

Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is having quite a schizophrenic year. At the end of May, Intel stock closed at $54.87 … good for over a 20% gain. To add context, this haul was more than twice that of the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLK ) over the same period.
However, INTC stock from June 1 represents the opposite, dropping nearly 21% in the markets. Worse yet, INTC has accelerated into the bearishness, with its 50-day-moving-average acting as resistance. Ominously, the 50-DMA is about to dip below the longer-term 200-DMA, setting off the ominously titled ""death cross.""
If that weren't enough, Intel stock is badly lagging its chief competitors, namely Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). After suffering choppy trading in the first few months of the year, AMD has veritably skyrocketed. Since mid-August, shares have actually gone parabolic.
How did this semiconductor stalwart get things so wrong?
Obviously, we can't ignore the troubles at the top . Around the time Intel stock initially began melting down, management forced former CEO Brian Krzanich to resign. Krzanich violated the company's non-fraternization policy when he engaged in a consensual relationship with another Intel employee.
7 Trucking Stocks to Buy as Retail Markets Shift Into Higher Gear
I can sympathize with the negative sentiment. Since the company's founding in 1968, INTC had only six CEOs. If investors couldn't rely on market stability, they sure could depend upon consistency in leadership. Not only is that trust gone out the window, Intel is considering outsiders for the top role. Again, this breaks with tradition, unsettling longtime shareholders.
The other issue is more pertinent to Intel stock. Struggling with various production issues, INTC stumbled on its 10-nanometer chips. And as our own James Brumley noted, Intel committed several fumbles that allowed competitors to catch up and dominate.
Intel Stock: Don't Miss the Forest for the Trees
Although I'm long-term bullish on INTC stock, I'm also realistic. The technical dangers are very real. Like any company experiencing volatility, I'd tread very carefully.
At the same time, I don't want to let an excessively conservative outlook prevent me from considering genuine contrarian opportunities. I realize it's a cliché, but I believe the bearishness is becoming overextended.
First, let's look at practicalities. The flavor of the month is AMD. But at its current price, I'm buying shares at 94-times trailing earnings, and nearly 50-times forward earnings. On the flipside for Intel stock, I'm looking at 16-times and 10.5-times for the previously discussed metrics.
Beyond that, you must also consider Intel's tremendous financial strengths. For example, INTC has a total cash position that exceeds $12 billion. AMD? In the most recent quarter, it reported less than $1 billion. Moreover, AMD can only spend a little over a billion in research and development. This contrasts sharply with Intel, which spent over $3.3 billion in the second quarter.
I'm not trying to compare the two companies. Rather, I'm saying that it makes more sense to buy fundamentally sound INTC on a discount than speculative AMD on a premium. Additionally, Intel can realistically work its way out of trouble thanks to the financial cushion. You can't say that about all the tech firm's competitors.
Plus, I can't give up on Intel stock, not when the underlying company is proving its worth despite the distractions. As an example, several shareholders dumped out of INTC when it slightly missed the data-center revenue target for Q2. But this overlooks the bigger picture, which shows consistent growth in this segment.
And let's not forget that with Intel's financial strengths, it can quickly shore up any weaknesses in data centers.
Bears Are Nitpicking With INTC Stock
I think the markets are focused too intently on old news (Krzanich) and somewhat misleading news (chip delays).
How the nasty CEO situation went down was and is a major distraction. Still, it's not enough to undo what remains a powerhouse organization.
Yes, the next-generation chip delays stink. But the company isn't getting bamboozled by its rivals. When INTC is on its game, as it demonstrated with its latest flagship Intel Core i9-9900K , nobody can beat them. That's why I'm comfortable speaking bullishly about Intel stock, even though it appears troubled.
As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

AMD AMD shares were surging again in morning trading Thursday after the popular chipmaker witnessed another positive analyst note, with FBN Securities initiating coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and a price target of $40. This call would represent a 24% climb from AMD's Wednesday close.
Elsewhere, AT&T T head Randall Stephenson started a small war of words with Netflix NFLX , jabbing the video streaming service while commenting at the Communacopia conference. Among other things, Stephenson called HBO ""the Tiffany"" of the sector and compared Netflix to Walmart.
Other companies making headlines Thursday morning include Etsy ETSY , which announced that it would not be refilling its chief operating officer role after the current holder resigns, and Tailored Brands TLRD , the Men's Wearhouse owner seeing sizeable morning gains after notching comps growth across all of its brands.
On this first half of today's show, Ryan recaps all of these stories and provides viewers with his own perspective on the news.
Later, the host reviews Apple's AAPL annual iPhone reveal event. Apple switched up the way it approaches ""S years"" by not only announcing updates to the iPhone X, but also revealing a more affordable model with many of the same features.
Apple also made some history with the announcement of the iPhone XS Max, which will feature the largest display ever seen on an iPhone.
On top of these iPhones, Apple continued to double down on the Watch as a personal health wearable, as its Watch Series 4 device includes even better heart rate monitoring and new fitness functionalities.
Make sure to check out the show as Ryan highlights each of these new products and speculates as to how they will fit into Apple's budding product ecosystem!

This compares to earnings of $1.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.37%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this software maker would post earnings of $1.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.66, delivering a surprise of 7.79%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Adobe, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $2.29 billion for the quarter ended August 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.96%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.84 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Adobe shares have added about 52.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.1%.
What's Next for Adobe?
While Adobe has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Adobe was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.82 on $2.39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.70 on $8.92 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Software is currently in the top 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Today the company is best known as an e-commerce giant, with online retail sales set to top $100 billion this year.
But Amazon is much more than just an online retailer. In fact, Amazon's financial reports reveal a company that is playing by different rules than its competitors. Rather than driving profits with online retail, as its peers do, Amazon is using e-commerce business to draw in customers and create a massive ecosystem, which it then leverages to generate profits in a number of other ways, including subscription services like Prime, third-party services through its marketplace, and advertising.
A shifting business
Amazon's business is built on its e-commerce operations. Its hundreds of warehouses in the U.S. and around the world give it the ability to stock a wide range of inventory and achieve the two-day delivery promised by its Prime loyalty program. However, growth in direct sales -- meaning transactions that Amazon handles entirely itself -- have slowed recently. In the last two quarters, Amazon reported sales growth from online stores, excluding foreign exchange, of just 13% and 12% respectively, its two slowest quarters since it started reporting results in 2016.
That pace is notably behind e-commerce growth nationwide, which stood at 15.8% over that time period. It also signals that Amazon is losing market share to rivals like Walmart and Target .
However, rather than being a sign of the company's challenges, that slowdown seems representative of its success. Online retail is a notoriously low-margin business, often yielding lower margins than traditional brick-and-mortar retail as online sellers have to deal with shipping costs and process returns. Therefore, it's not a great way to generate profits.
Amazon now controls about half of online sales in the U.S., but the businesses enabled by its e-commerce success are growing much faster and generating significant profits along the way. Subscription services, which include Prime along with Kindle Unlimited, Amazon Video, and Amazon Music, jumped 57% last quarter to $3.4 billion. Prime recently reached 100 million members , showing how successful the loyalty program has been.
Third-party seller services, which include commissions, fulfillment, shipping fees, and payment processing, may eventually be the company's biggest business, as sales in the category jumped 39% in the most recent quarter to $9.7 billion. Since Amazon's marketplace business relies on infrastructure already in place to support the company's own e-commerce operations, it is likely highly profitable, especially given that marketplace businesses like eBay tend to generate significant profit margins.
Finally, advertising may now be Amazon's fastest-growing business , and one made possible by its strength in e-commerce. In its most recent quarter, other revenue, which is primarily made up advertising, jumped 132% to $2.2 billion. Over the last year Amazon has doubled the number of sponsor ads in its searches, unlocking a potentially huge revenue stream, one that has driven tens of billions in profits for tech giants Alphabet and Facebook .
Amazon doesn't report profits in those individual segments, but the bottom-line growth from those businesses can be see in North American operating profits, which jumped from $436 million to $1.8 billion in the second quarter. Though the Whole Foods acquisition contributed to that improvement, it likely only added $250 million in operating income at most during the period.
Don't forget AWS
Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, continues to put up blockbuster growth, along with much of the cloud computing industry . In the most recent quarter, sales jumped 49% to $6.1 billion, and operating income surged 79% to $1.6 billion. More blockbuster growth should be on the way in the cloud segment as businesses continue to tap its scalable service to meet their needs. In fact, one analyst sees AWS revenue tripling to $60 billion by 2022.
Add it all up and you have a much different Amazon than even five years ago. It's a unique business with a huge economic moat that can leverage its giant e-commerce operations to generate wide margins in areas like third-party seller services and advertising.
That's one big reason why Amazon just topped $1 trillion in market value, and why it could soon be the most valuable company in the world.

That news dashed earlier hopes stemming from reports that the U.S. was proposing a new round of trade talks with China that could have eased tensions.
After spending much of Friday in the red, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) and the S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) managed to just barely edge into positive territory to end the day.
Today's stock market
DATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE.
Oil stocks enjoyed another solid session, leaving the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP) up 0.5%. But consumer goods stocks led the day's decliners, and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT: XLP) fell by as much as 0.8% before closing down just 0.3%.
Among individual stocks, earnings news helped both Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Dave & Buster's (NASDAQ: PLAY) resist the broader market's headwinds.
Adobe renders another quarterly beat
Shares of Adobe Systems climbed 2.3% Friday to a new all-time high after the creative software leader delivered record fiscal third-quarter 2018 results . Quarterly revenue rose 24.4% year over year to $2.291 billion, while adjusted earnings grew more than 57% to $860 million, or $1.73 per share. Both figures landed above Adobe's most recent guidance, which called for earnings of $1.68 per share on revenue of $2.24 billion.
Perhaps most impressive, 90% of Adobe's revenue came from recurring sources, a metric driven by the company's shift in recent years away from perpetual licenses and toward a cloud-based subscription model. To be sure, Adobe's Digital media annualized recurring revenue grew by $339 million from last quarter to $6.4 billion.
If that wasn't enough, Adobe told investors to expect fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share on revenue of $2.42 billion. Here again, both figures were slightly above analysts' consensus estimates.
Dave & Buster's Earnings
Dave & Buster's touched a 52-week high today before slipping back to a 7.9% gain, driven by the restaurant and entertainment chain's delicious fiscal second-quarter report.
More specifically, Dave & Buster's recorded earnings of $33.8 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, while revenue climbed 13.7% year over year (or 11.4% on a comparable-week basis) to $319.2 million. Still, its top-line growth was driven entirely by new locations, as comparable-store sales declined 2.4%. But that metric also marked a notable improvement from a 4.9% comps decline last quarter . What's more, most analysts watching the stock were only modeling for earnings of $0.67 per share on revenue of $315.3 million.
""We delivered meaningful sequential improvement in comparable store sales and double-digit revenue growth during the second quarter,"" said CEO Brian Jenkins. ""We are pleased with the strong guest response to our proprietary VR platform and look forward to building on this momentum.""
In the meantime, Dave & Buster's now expects fiscal 2018 revenue in the range of $1.230 billion to $1.255 billion (up from a forecast of $1.200 billion to $1.240 billion before), assuming a low-single-digit decrease in comparable-store sales (up from prior expectations for a low- to mid-single-digit decline). The company also raised both ends of its full-year net income target range by $6 million, for new a earnings guidance range of $101 million to $111 million.

Technology stocks scratched out a small gain on Friday, with the shares of tech stocks in the S&P 500 adding about 0.1% in value while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose over 1.1% this afternoon.
Among technology stocks moving on news:
(+) NVIDIA ( NVDA ) rose almost 2% on Friday after analysts at Needham & Co raised their price target for the visual and graphics chipmaker by $25 to $350 a share and also reiterated their Buy stock rating for the company's stock.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.56%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.35%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.43%.
Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 69.27% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.71% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.44% in that time.
AMD will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 23, 2018. In that report, analysts expect AMD to post earnings of $0.12 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 20%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.71 billion, up 3.95% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $0.47 per share and revenue of $6.69 billion. These totals would mark changes of +176.47% and +25.54%, respectively, from last year.
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.21% lower. AMD is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.
Digging into valuation, AMD currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 89.82. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 18.28.
It is also worth noting that AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 6.42. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.58 at yesterday's closing price.
The Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, which puts it in the top 33% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

Adobe's revenue rose 24% annually to $2.29 billion, clearing estimates by $40 million. Its non-GAAP net income rose 57% to $860 million, or $1.73 per share, which topped expectations by four cents. On a GAAP basis, its net income rose 59% to $666 million, or $1.34 per share.
For the fourth quarter, Adobe expects its revenue to grow 20% annually to $2.42 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $2.41 billion.
Adobe seems like it's firing on all cylinders, but its stock already surged nearly 80% over the past 12 months. Is there still room for this stock to run, or should investors wait for a pullback?
Breaking down the key numbers
Adobe generates most of its revenue from two main businesses: the Digital Media unit, which houses its flagship Creative Cloud services; and the Digital Experience unit, which provides cloud-based marketing and analytics tools.
Adobe's Digital Media revenue rose 27% annually to $1.61 billion during the quarter. Creative Cloud revenue accounted for $1.36 billion of that total. The remaining $249 million came from its Document Cloud business. The Digital Media unit's total ARR (annualized recurring revenue) rose $339 million sequentially to $6.4 billion.
Adobe attributed that growth to subscription gains across the US, Europe, and Asia, strong momentum in emerging markets, rising app subscriptions, the retention of users upgrading from promotional to standard prices, and increased seats across the enterprise market. Adobe's Stock (stock photos), Acrobat (documents), and Sign (e-documents) software platforms also generated high double-digit sales growth.
Adobe's Digital Experience revenue grew 21% annually to $614 million. Within that total, its subscription revenue rose 25% annually. Adobe attributed that growth to the strength of its Analytics, Marketing, and Advertising Cloud products. Its Audience Manager (data management) and Campaign (marketing campaign) platforms were also standout performers.
Adobe also noted that Magento, which it acquired earlier this year, was ""off to a strong start"" and generated $27 million in subscription and services revenue during the quarter. Magento is a web store that helps merchants digitize their businesses with websites, ads, payments services, analytics, and customer relationship management (CRM) services.
A recent Reuters report also claims that Adobe could purchase cloud marketing software firm Marketo to further strengthen that business. That could be bad news for Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) , which competes against Magento in the fragmented web store market.
Adobe's total subscription revenue grew 29% annually during the quarter and accounted for 88% of its top line, indicating that its multi-year shift from selling licensed software to cloud-based services is paying off.
Margins and profitability
Adobe's gross and operating margins also improved significantly from the prior year quarter thanks to its transition toward higher-margin cloud subscription services:
Source: Adobe quarterly reports.
Adobe's scale also gives it superior margins compared to smaller rivals like Shopify, which has negative operating margins and remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis. Moreover, Adobe's ""best in breed"" reputation in the digital media market, with products like Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere, gives it a wide moat and immense pricing power -- two advantages which many cloud service players lack.
That's why Adobe maintains higher margins than its cloud rivals like Shopify and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) , which leads the CRM market but faces tough competition from companies like Microsoft .

Does Adobe still have room to run?
Adobe trades at 36 times forward earnings, which is a surprisingly low valuation for a high-growth cloud company. For comparison, Shopify trades at over 260 times forward earnings, and Salesforce has a forward P/E of nearly 60.
Adobe's flagship products also don't face any meaningful competition, and its expanding cloud platforms should give it plenty of room to cross-sell and up-sell new services to its locked-in customers. That strategy should help Adobe generate even stronger sales and earnings growth over the long term. Therefore, I think Adobe could still climb higher over the next few years.

Reportedly, this e-commerce giant will offer products in 15 categories, including books, electronics, tools, toys and baby goods, from over 1,000 Turkish businesses to customers across the country.
Amazon's launch comes at a difficult time as the Turkish economy battles recession. The country's currency, Lira continues to plunge amid political uncertainties, fiscal tightening and a frail banking system. Further, sanctions imposed by the United States after Turkey refused to release American pastor, Andrew Brunson have been a major setback for the economy.
Per Business Insider, the slump in currency has accelerated inflation, which hit a 15-year high of nearly 16% in July, this year. Moreover, industrial production in the second quarter contracted 0.7% against growth of 1.8% in the first quarter.
Reportedly, Turkish economy grew 5.2% in the second quarter, down from 7.3% expansion in the first quarter. The economy is now expected to contract in the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019. Per OECD data , economic growth is expected to be almost 5% in both 2018 and 2019, which is, however, much better than many other European economies.
Turkish E-commerce Growth Projections Solid
Notably, Turkey, with a population of 80 million, is the world's 17th largest economy, per International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country has a predominantly younger population, and rapid adoption of smartphone has accelerated the proliferation of e-commerce and m-commerce.
Per Informatics Industry Association (TUBISAD), e-commerce market in Turkey was worth almost €6.6 billion in 2016, which was estimated to reach €8.6 billion in 2017 and €10 billion by the end of this year.
The Association of E-commerce Operators (ETID) expects e-commerce market in Turkey to grow between 30% and 35% in 2018. Moreover, e-commerce accounted for a mere 3.5% of the total trade sector in Turkey, which reflects significant room for growth.
These factors bode well for Amazon. Notably, Turkey is the first European country outside the European Union (EU), where this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is launching its operations. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .
Amazon's Expanding Global Footprint to Aid Growth
Amazon's expanding seller base, distribution strength, strategic acquisitions and partnerships bode well for its dominant position in the global e-commerce market.

Based on its Prime service, the company has expanded into countries like Australia, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Singapore. It also has an additional facility for customers in Belgium to join Prime and shop in Dutch.
Reportedly, the company is gearing up to make its foray into the clothing, accessories and footwear market of Brazil via its Brazilian marketplace. The latest move will strengthen its footprint in Brazil as well as Latin America.
Recently, Amazon introduced the Hindi version of its online shopping website and application for mobile to make shopping easier for Indians. This bodes well for its strong focus to address the next 100 million customers in India, per Reuters.
We note that Amazon's continuous efforts toward expanding its presence worldwide will help it in sustaining leadership position in the e-commerce market. Furthermore, expansions are strengthening Amazon's competitive position against its global rivals - Walmart WMT , eBay EBAY and Alibaba BABA .
Moreover, the global expansion is expected to drive top-line growth. For third-quarter 2018, Amazon expects net sales between $54 billion and $57.5 billion. The figure is anticipated to grow in the range of 23-31% on a year-over-year basis.
Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies
It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Every now and then investors can let emotions get the better of them, buying (or selling) a stock for all the wrong reasons. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has been one of those stocks. While its turnaround is real, the bulk of the 200%+ rally AMD stock has dished out since mid-April was rooted in hype rather than results.
10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills
That's usually not a trap level-headed analysts fall into. They get paid to think critically and clearly, and most of them have seen enough to know a stock's price always, eventually, reflects a company's fundamentals.
Over the course of the past several days, though, it appears more than a few professional stock handicappers have jumped on the bandwagon for all the wrong reason. Afraid of not making a bold call on a red-hot stock, a couple of newcomers have served up head-turning price target increases and upgrades. It looks as if even the pros are losing perspective.
Johnny-Come-Latelies
The latest entry into the contest of who's willing to make the most aggressive call on AMD stock? Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy raised his price target on Thursday, from $21 to $38 . That's more than 20% higher than Wednesday's close near $31.
That upped target was even bolder, though less dramatic, than Morgan Stanley's big swing from the day before. Prior to Wednesday, its target on Advanced Micro Devices stock was only $11 - well below the consensus and its actual price - but analyst Joseph Moore catapulted his target to $28 , explaining that rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has ""oversold"" the actual value of its processors in the past and was now paying the price for lazy R&D and excessive pricing.
That move followed Tuesday's new call from Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh. He raised his target 80% in one fell swoop, from $20 to $36 . He also upped his target on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), though more modestly, from $280 to $295.
Question: Where the heck were these guys, and where was their optimism, just a month ago when AMD shares were hovering around $20? As of mid-August, these pros were saying the stock was only worth around $18.30. Now these analysts are saying it's worth nearly $24 per share.

Might these professionals merely be hoping to capture a piece of the momentum, since most of them missed the bulk of the rally between May and August? Just asking.
It's a close cousin to ""performance chasing,"" which is simply the act of buying into a stock hoping its recent-past gains will continue, whether or not you can reasonably expect more gains ahead. Sometimes that is a reasonable expectation, when the hype is strong enough - and it may well be strong enough with a well-loved turnaround story like Advanced Micro Devices. It doesn't take a trading veteran to realize, however, that this kind of mentality is tantamount to playing with fire.
You just usually don't see it with analysts, one of which currently sports a price target of $40.
Doubters Stick to Their Guns
And just for the record, it's not like crazy calls aren't materializing at the other end of the spectrum. Piper Jaffray's chief market technician Craig Johnson just cautioned this week that, given its history, AMD stock could fall as much as 100% .
There was no fundamental basis to the argument. It was a purely technical one, ignoring the recent revenue and earnings trajectory.
The lowest analyst target for Advanced Micro Devices stock right now is $7, which is 77% less than its current price. The range of price targets on AMD may (relatively speaking) be the widest for any equity.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
Calling a spade a spade, a handful of analysts have been lured into the hype, suffering the same FOMO (fear of missing out) all amateur investors do. A wide swath of them didn't become bullish until it became very easy to be bullish - when the stock was racing higher. That's fine, but as was noted, it can be a dangerous game. The music will stop playing sooner or later, and there's simply not enough fundamental justification for a price anywhere near its current price.
The real headache for investors is, however, sifting through all the differing analyst calls; even some of the optimistic ones are paired with target prices below the stock's present price.
7 Activist Stocks for Investors to Consider
The consensus price target is right around $24 right now, and the consensus is usually an on-target figure. Traders would be wise to expect a trip back to that area sooner or later. Until then, there are any number of possible outcomes. If you're riding the hype, be careful.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

About Peter Lynch : Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (""Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,"" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a ""stocks for the everyman/everywoman"", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

Here we dial in to three of the most bullish stock ratings from three top-ranked RBC Capital analysts. As you will see below, all three of the analysts referred to below score highly when it comes to the complex art of stock picking.
How do we know? TipRanks tracks and ranks over 4,800 analysts, letting us focus on the ratings from analysts who consistently outperform the market. Let’s take a closer look at three of their most compelling stock recommendations now:
AMD (AMD)
AMD investors rejoice. This volatile chip stocking has the backing of RBC Capital’s Mitch Steves (Track Record & Ratings). Steves has just initiated AMD coverage with a Buy rating and a $40 price target. This Street-high price target translates into 23% upside from current levels.
So what is driving the bullish sentiment for this top analyst? “Our thesis is based on: 1) solid server share gains; 2) continued demand for gaming chips; and 3) notable operating margin leverage” writes Steves on September 24.
In particular, Steves sees AMD capturing a larger portion of the server market growing to mid-singles and working towards 20%+, similar to dynamics last seen in 2006. “Despite positive news surrounding 7nm chips from TSMC, we think server market growth is still undervalued” he concludes.
AMD has confirmed that its first 7nm GPU will be released later this year, while the first 7nm CPUs will come out next year. Excitingly for AMD, if Intel’s 10nm Cannon Lake processor is pushed to 4Q19 (as recent reports suggest), AMD would gain a ‘notable head-start’ against its larger rival.
Overall, the Street look remains slightly more cautious. Its Moderate Buy analyst consensus is the result of 11 buy ratings, 8 hold ratings and 1 sell rating- all within the last three months. This produces an average price target of $28.22 (13% downside potential).
However, Steves points out that AMD trades at a notable discount on a sales basis relative to another GPU stock- Nvidia (NVDA). Right now Nvidia (its closest peer) trades at 11x sales. His price target gives AMD a multiple that is half as large. See AMD Price Target and Analyst Rating Details.
Alibaba (BABA)
Fresh from the Alibaba Investor Day, RBC’s Mark Mahaney (Track Record & Ratings) returns with a reaffirmed confidence in the stock’s outlook. He has just reiteterated his Buy rating on Alibaba with a $215 price target (32% upside potential).
“We believe management did an impressive job of explaining their long-term vision of empowering businesses to succeed in a digital era” explains this five-star analyst.
Most notably, he spies a significant opportunity for the stock in cloud computing. As of FY18, 40% of China’s top 500 companies were on the Alibaba Cloud while 49% of China listed companies were on Alibaba Cloud, both 9pp increases from FY17.
Overall, “cloud continues to demonstrate hyper- growth (+93% Y/Y)” and this makes BABA a great play on the dramatic secular growth that is the Internet. Combine this with China’s rapid per capita GDP growth, and management’s ‘long-term focus’ and ‘excellent execution’, and you can see why this stock falls firmly in Mahaney’s Buy-list.
Bear in mind, the Street is also unanimously positive on BABA’s outlook. Alongside Mahaney, 16 analysts have published buy ratings on the stock in the last three months. This comes with a bullish average price target of $235- indicating sizeable upside potential of almost 44%. See BABA Price Target and Analyst Rating Details.
Smartsheet Inc (SMAR)
RBC’s Ross MacMillan (Track Record & Ratings) is one of the five top analysts ranked by TipRanks (out of over 4,800). And one of his ‘Buy’-rated picks right now is Smartsheet Inc. This is a leading work management platform with nearly 100,000 customers. Companies use its products to manage workflows and facilitate collaboration.
On the back of F2Q19 results that demonstrated strength across the board, MacMillan boosted his price target from $32 to $39. This indicates 28% upside potential from current levels.
“SMAR again reported strong results, with billings re- acceleration (+55% Y/Y vs +50% in F1Q19), better net customer adds, ACV growth and net dollar retention” the analyst comments.
And looking forward, MacMillan singles out three key reasons why SMAR is primed to move higher. Not only does the company boast very strong unit economics (think net dollar retention rates >130%), but it is also looking at a massive market opportunity. “With 650K paid users today, we think the company is scratching the surface of the opportunity when compared with the >200M paid commercial Office users and ~865M knowledge workers globally” states MacMillan.
Encouragingly, Smartsheet has a flexible platform that can co-exist with other productivity and collaboration apps- suggesting it has what it takes to corner a much larger share of the work automation market.
Like BABA, analysts are out in full force in favor of the stock. With six back-to-back Buy ratings, SMAR boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. Meanwhile the average analyst price target stands at $36.33 (19% upside potential). See SMAR Price Target and Analyst Rating Details.

So content distribution network CDN Cloudflare, which garnered experience through its Interconnect partnership with Alphabet's GOOGL Google Cloud, has gone a step further to take the concept to a broader group of providers including Microsoft MSFT Azure, IBM IBM Cloud, Automattic, Backblaze, DigitalOcean, DreamHost, linode, packet, Scaleway and Vapor through what it calls the Bandwidth Alliance.
To understand the benefit, we need to understand the problem first: infrastructure providers typically don't charge for data coming to them but only for data that leaves their infrastructure, so customers that have committed more money to a particular provider find it almost impossible to leave. This helps providers to grow their customer base but limits what customers can do with their data.
This wasn't much of a problem while most of the work continued to be done onsite and providers continued to add to their offerings. But with the cloud growing rapidly in the last few years, providers are likely recognizing the fact that they can increase efficiency and conserve resources by sticking with their core competence and allowing customers to find other providers for their other needs.
Naturally, in order for this to happen, data needs to be able to move freely across host systems, which isn't possible if the customer is charged every time. So cloud players are in effect agreeing not to charge customers repeatedly when it isn't required by signing a pact with their CDN partner, which will facilitate the movement.
In Google's case, the arrangement resulted in a 75% reduction in bandwidth or egress fees for customers when traffic was offloaded to Cloudflare's private network interface (PNI) and directed by its router system. Microsoft recently started a similar arrangement with Cloudflare, but unlike Google, it went ahead with the Bandwidth Alliance as well. Amazon's AMZN AWS isn't part of the deal either, but the company may join in later.
This is one of several data sharing deals announced recently, the other two being between Microsoft, SAP and Adobe ADBE and between Salesforce CRM and AWS (actually an expansion of their earlier arrangement).

(Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new November 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $33.00 strike price has a current bid of 91 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $33.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $32.09 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $33.64/share today.
Because the $33.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.76% return on the cash commitment, or 23.38% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $33.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $34.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.18. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $33.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $34.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.58% if the stock gets called away at the November 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $34.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $34.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.51% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.75% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $33.64) to be 27%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $34.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $34.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.51% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.75% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $33.64) to be 27%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Brian is CNBC cryptocurrencies correspondent and author of the book ""The Bitcoin Big Bang: How Alternative Currencies Are About to Change the World.""
Bitcoin had skyrocketed to above $19,500 in December last year from around $1,000 at the beginning of the year. It is now trading around $6,400.
First off, we discussed whether individuals should invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We also talked about the ICO market.
Late month, the SEC rejected 9 bitcoin proposals from 3 different issuers. In July, they had reiterated their decision to reject Winklevoss bitcoin ETF proposal. Then last week, they postponed the decision on VanEck/SolidX bitcoin ETF again.
The SEC is mainly concerned about the potential for fraud and manipulation. Custody also remains a potential issue. The agency has also mentioned low trading volumes of bitcoin futures.
Will we see a bitcoin ETF any time soon? What is the SEC looking for?
We then talked about the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and its transformative potential.
""Blockchain could be more disruptive than the internet,""-Brian explained why.
BKC holds global stocks that generate revenue from cryptocurrency-related and enterprise blockchain technology-related companies. Greg explained how companies are selected for inclusion in the portfolio.
AMD ( AMD ), Overstock ( OSTK ), Square ( SQ ) and CME Group ( CME ) are among the top holdings in the portfolio.
BKC is actively managed by Brian Kelly. We discussed the importance of active management in this rapidly evolving space.
While many investors associate blockchain only with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the technology has so has many applications in other areas.
What else should investors know about bitcoin and blockchain? Find out on the podcast.

ADBE will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be December 13, 2018. In that report, analysts expect ADBE to post earnings of $1.88 per share.

Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.80 per share and revenue of $8.99 billion. These totals would mark changes of +57.77% and +23.12%, respectively, from last year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for ADBE. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

Best Electric Car Stock? You'll Never Guess It.
Zacks Research has released a report that may shock many investors. One stock stands out as the best way to invest in the surge to electric cars. And it's not the one you may think!
Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium battery power is set to shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, revenues that were already at $31 billion in 2016 are expected to blast to over $67 billion by the end of 2022.

Stocks may have gotten Tuesday's trading started on the right foot, but they certainly didn't end them that way. Although the S&P 500 managed to claw back some of what was at one point an intraday loss of 0.17%, the 0.04% loss the index ended up logging yesterday was still not a gain - and the market needed a decisive gain.
That modest loss could have been much bigger had it not been for General Electric (NYSE: GE ), which advanced 1.9% as investors continue celebrating the potential a new CEO poses . On the other hand, the market's small loss might have been a respectable gain has Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) not suffered a 7.6% loss as the market continues to figure out just where it stands with rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ).
That headline-driven action is exactly why none of these story stocks are well-suited for trading right now. The key at this time is getting the right read on stock charts, and it's the charts of KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY ), Copart (NASDAQ: CPRT ) and Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ: AKAM ) that are most telling as we head into Wednesday's session.
KeyCorp (KEY)
The past several days haven't been enjoyable ones for bank stocks, and KeyCorp hasn't been an exception to that norm. But, the sheer scope of the selling has some traders suggesting the weakness may be about to be replaced by bullishness again.
17 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double
And, that may well be the way things pan out. If not, though, KEY shares are one bad day away from breaking under a crucially important support level. Worse, KeyCorp is facing the test with an eyebrow-raising backdrop.
Click to Enlarge • The make-or-break line joins most of the major lows going all the way back to April and is plotted with a red, dashed line on both stock charts.
• KeyCorp has used this line as a pushoff point before, but this time is different. This time, it's in the shadow of a major lower low; the August peak was below March's high.
• In the weekly timeframe, KEY has not only already broken below another important support line, plotted in blue, but we've also already seen a bearish MACD cross. The downward momentum is already formed.
Copart (CPRT)
After an amazing 2016/2017 rally, Copart was due for a wave of profit-taking. That's what happened last month. In response to a disappointing fourth quarter report, CPRT shares were up-ended in a huge way.
It wasn't the setback in and of itself that's put the stock in jeopardy right now, however. It's what's happened in the meantime, or more specifically, what's not happened in the meantime, that's brought Copart shares to the brink of another round of major selling.
Click to Enlarge • The real killer here was Monday's retest of the moving average line, plotted in white, at $52.97. The bulls were willing to push up and off the developing support level around $50.86 and try to get back above the long-term moving average line, but the buyers couldn't get over the hump.
• Now CPRT shares have peeled back, and once again are putting pressure on the support line at $50.86. If it snaps, there's not much left that will be able to stop a second wave of selling.
• Zooming out to the weekly chart not only gives us some more perspective, it gives us a couple more prospective technical floors. The nearest one is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line is at $47.77, and the next is the 61.8% retracement at $35.70.
Akamai Technologies (AKAM)
Last but not least, Akamai Technologies shares are no stranger to volatility. In fact, you can pretty much count on wide, wild swings from it. Thanks to Monday's bearish hint and Tuesday's confirming clue, though, odds are very good that we're all the way back into an all-too-familiar selling groove.
Click to Enlarge • The big clue is this week's move below the 200-day moving average line, which is plotted in white on both stock charts. Crosses of this long-term moving average line tend to last a while, up or down.
• Simultaneously, we've seen bearish crossovers - or crossunders, technically speaking - of all the other key moving average lines. This underscores how well developed the new downward momentum has been developed.
• The clincher, so to speak, is the fact that so much bearish volume has taken shape just since early last month. The Chaikin is back under zero on the weekly chart, while the daily chart's accumulation-distribution line is now sloped downward. There were clearly at least some would-be sellers just waiting in the wings.

Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have been on fire throughout 2018, rising an impressive 67% so far on the year. Even more impressive, Amazon stock is up more than 100% over the past 12 months, as momentum has stayed strong in this now $1 trillion name.
That may make investors leery to invest in Amazon. It doesn't have the balance sheet strength of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), another name we like in the fourth quarter, and its valuation is wildly elevated when using traditional methods.
But here's the thing: Amazon isn't a traditional company. Had all those bears sold AMZN stock short five or ten years ago and stayed short they'd all be bankrupt by now as it was overvalued then too.
7 Stocks Under $10 You Shouldn't Buy
Clearly Amazon and its investors operate under a different set of rules. Those that want to fight it can do so at their own peril. Of course, one day the trend in Amazon stock will falter and shares will decline. It could happen next week, next month or next quarter. There's no sure way to predict the short-term action of any stock or index.
But because of Amazon's growing power in growing markets like ecommerce, cloud and advertising, investors continue to give CEO Jeff Bezos and his team the benefit of the doubt. Does that make it a name to hold through the end of the year?
Year-End Catalysts for Amazon Stock
When Amazon reports its fiscal third-quarter earnings results later this month, it will include the company's results from Prime Day. Those results should be monstrous and help give Amazon an even greater boost to revenue. It essentially created a Black Friday shopping event in the middle of summer. Brilliant.
The company is heading into the ever-important holiday season. The conference call will be key but regardless, it should be a good fourth quarter for Amazon. That could mean good things for names like United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ) and FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) as well.
Last quarter, the company's earnings of $5.07 per share came in more than double consensus expectations. Clearly Amazon has momentum in its main business right now.
Retail will certainly be a catalyst this quarter, but so too will Amazon Web Services. We've seen stellar cloud growth out of companies like Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) and others. Given that Amazon is atop the leaderboard in terms of market share, there's little question that it too will continue to do well thanks to the cloud.
Cloud stocks have the wind to their backs and, as I said with Amazon earlier, eventually that wind will shift direction or at the very least die down. But until that happens, there's no reason to bet against these stocks.
It's impressive to see a company the size of Amazon growing at the rate it is. Expectations call for 32% revenue growth this year and almost 300% earnings growth. Still, valuing AMZN is tough, because there's just no telling how big this juggernaut is going to become. That makes it a perfect dip-buying name.
Trading AMZN Stock Price
Click to Enlarge
This is where the action can get a little tricky. So far, Amazon stock remains in a strong uptrend. That's shown by the repetitive bounces off the 50-day and uptrend support (black line).
However, with the decline in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT ) and as yields climb, it may be worth asking if AMZN stock will come under short-term pressure, tech stocks don't like higher rates. If so, first see how Amazon handles trend support and the $1,900 level.
If it gives way, shares would be susceptible to a pullback to the $1,850 level. This area (highlighted on the chart as ""No. 1"") is a series of three levels conveniently spaced about $100 apart.
Each level was prior resistance that eventually gave way and became support. Getting to support No. 2 seems unlikely without a poor earnings reaction later this month or a market wide correction. Support No. 3 almost certainly needs one of those two negative catalysts (or both) to get it there.
However, the bottom line is simple: Amazon stock is a buy-on-dips name until the strategy fails. If you're long-term bearish AMZN, your best course of action may be to treat as you would your sentiment's mascot: Leave it be.

Wednesday was the second winning day for the S&P 500 this week, but like the other two trading sessions, it has been a struggle. All the indices once again peeled back from intraday highs, with the bulls unwilling to keep the pressure on through the closing bell.
Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) did a great deal of the heavy lifting, gaining 1.4% as investors realized they've been overly tough on banks of late. At the other end of the spectrum, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) arguably did the most damage, losing 2% of its value as traders continue to rethink they're unquestioned bullishness on the stock of late.
As for Thursday's best bets, take a look at stock charts of Lennar (NYSE: LEN ), Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) and International Paper (NYSE: IP ). A couple of them have fallen past the point of no return, while the third one is setting up a breakout thrust.
Lennar (LEN)
When we last looked at Lennar back on Sept. 21 , it was putting pressure on a major support line at $50 but had not yet broken under it. Given the selling pressure that was being persistently applied, though, it appeared like that breakdown was inevitable. That breakdown ended up taking shape two trading days later, and as suspected, the follow-through was significant.
10 Stocks to Buy When the Yield Curve Inverts
For a brief while over the course of the past few days it looked like the bulls were finally ready to stop the bleeding. With Wednesday's action in the rear-view mirror, however, traders may want to gear up for another round of selling.
Click to Enlarge • Last week, Lennar shares reversed the selling effort at $46.46, which is plotted with a white, dashed line. Wednesday's dip, though, pulled LEN back under that nascent floor. There's no other plausible support line in sight.
• The telling sign here, however, is the sheer degree of volume behind the selloff and the fact that the bearish volume continues to grow. There may be even more sellers waiting in the wings.
• Zooming out to a weekly chart, we can see that the recent pullback completes a head-and-shoulders pattern that began to form back in early 2017. That setup bolsters the bearish case now.
Kinder Morgan (KMI)
Most oil and gas stocks have been dishing out gains of late, in step with rising crude and natural gas prices. Pipeline company Kinder Morgan hasn't been an exception to that norm.
Kinder Morgan shares are taking on a slightly different and telling shape though. They've not made any net progress since July, but with three months of consolidation setting up a make-or-break technical resistance line, one good nudge could open the buying floodgates.
Click to Enlarge • The line in the sand is $18.31, where KMI has peaked several times since July, but has yet to move above.
• If the right catalyst was all that was needed, it may have materialized last week. That sharp pullback only had to kiss the gray 100-day moving average line to draw in another round of buyers.
• In the weekly timeframe, we can see Kinder Morgan has already broken above the falling resistance line that had been guiding it lower since early 2017.
International Paper (IP)
Last but not least, International Paper was one of the three stock charts in focus back on Sept. 28 . At the time, IP was close to breaking below a well-established technical floor, but had not yet done so. It happened that very day.
That's not the most interesting, and bearish, part of the International Paper story, however. In fact, IP started to recover the very next day. It was Wednesday's follow-through that sealed the bearish deal and set the stage for more selling ahead.
Click to Enlarge • The support line in question was $50, plotted in yellow on both stock charts. International Paper shares crept back above that level late last week and earlier this week, but in retrospect it was a setup for an even harder fall to new 52-week lows.
• The surge in selling volume since the selloff late last month leaves little doubt that investors really, really can't get rid of this stock fast enough.
• Zooming out to a weekly chart we can see that not only has International Paper completed a head-and-shoulders pattern, but that there's a great deal of room for it to keep falling. There's no prior low point in a position to act as a floor anywhere nearby.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.
This chipmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19.44%.
For the most recent quarter, Advanced Micro was expected to post earnings of $0.12 per share, but it reported $0.14 per share instead, representing a surprise of 16.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.09 per share, while it actually produced $0.11 per share, a surprise of 22.22%.
Price and EPS Surprise
For Advanced Micro, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Advanced Micro has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 23, 2018.
With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.
This chipmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 19.44%.
For the most recent quarter, Advanced Micro was expected to post earnings of $0.12 per share, but it reported $0.14 per share instead, representing a surprise of 16.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.09 per share, while it actually produced $0.11 per share, a surprise of 22.22%.
Price and EPS Surprise
For Advanced Micro, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Advanced Micro has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 23, 2018.
With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

It could have been worse. Rather than book the modest 0.04% loss that it took on Monday, the S&P 500 could have ended the day down closer to its intraday loss of 0.8%. Nevertheless, the market is clearly on the defensive here, dancing dangerously close to some pivotal support levels.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) once again did the most net damage, losing 3.2% of its value as investors continue to grapple with the sheer weight of its story-induced gains. It was Square (NYSE: SQ ) that suffered the biggest loss among the notable names, however, with SQ stock plunging 8.6% in response to BTIG analyst Mark Palmer's warning that the company may be facing more credit risk than investors realize . Not even the 3.1% jump from General Electric (NYSE: GE ), stemming from rekindled hope of a recovery, was enough to drag the broad market back into the black yesterday.
None of those names are particularly well-suited for speculative trading today, however. Rather, stock charts of Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE: IPG ), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN ) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ) are shaping up as the best bets. Here's why, and what to look for.
Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG)
If Interpublic Group of Companies rings oddly familiar, there's a reason. It was one of the names put under the trading microscope back at the beginning of the month . At the time, it was working its way into the tip of a converging wedge pattern, but it wasn't yet clear in which direction it would be squeezed out of that pattern.
5 Marijuana Stocks to Stay Far Away From
Thanks to recent bullishness that defies the market tide, we've got some new, compelling clarity on that front.
Click to Enlarge • Thanks to Monday's relatively modest 0.2% gain from IPG shares, the stock has broken above the falling resistance line, plotted in yellow, that had been guiding it lower for weeks.
• It's not just the move above a technical ceiling though. Underscoring the nascent bullishness is the flood of buying volume that's materializes over the course of the past week and a half. The buyers appear to have tipped their hand.
• Should this breakout thrust take hold, there's a significant technical ceiling around $23.60, where Interpublic Group of Companies peaked several times last year and early this year. This resistance is plotted in blue on the weekly chart.
Devon Energy (DVN)
Devon Energy has been something of an outlier of late. Although most oil and gas stocks have at least held their ground in sync with firm natural gas and crude oil prices, DVN stock has been fighting a losing battle. That battle moved to a critical tipping point on Monday though, and the tide looks decidedly bearish.
Click to Enlarge • The tipping point in question is the $38.60, around where Devon shares hit a low not just yesterday, but last month, as well as in late June.
• Fanning the bearish flames is yesterday's cross back under the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, against a backdrop of decidedly strong selling volume. The accumulation-distribution line has been falling faster than the stock has since early August.
• As unlikely as a trip all the way back to that level seems at this point, the weekly stock chart suggests there's something supportive about the $30 level.
Adobe Systems (ADBE)
Finally, while Adobe Systems has built an impressive business-minded software suite that drives lots of recurring revenue, this is one of those names that's arguably gotten a little ahead of itself. Over the course of the past several months it hasn't mattered. ADBE shares managed to find support when and where it needed to.
As of Monday though, those key lines in the sand are no longer keeping the selling effort at bay. One more decent drubbing and the weight of the gains since early last year may well unravel.

• One has to zoom out to the weekly chart to realize it, but we've been in the shadow of a bearish MACD cross since July, and with the Chaikin line's cross below zero this week, we can confirm there's quietly been a lot of profit-taking of late already.

It could have been worse. Rather than book the modest 0.04% loss that it took on Monday, the S&P 500 could have ended the day down closer to its intraday loss of 0.8%. Nevertheless, the market is clearly on the defensive here, dancing dangerously close to some pivotal support levels.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) once again did the most net damage, losing 3.2% of its value as investors continue to grapple with the sheer weight of its story-induced gains. It was Square (NYSE: SQ ) that suffered the biggest loss among the notable names, however, with SQ stock plunging 8.6% in response to BTIG analyst Mark Palmer's warning that the company may be facing more credit risk than investors realize . Not even the 3.1% jump from General Electric (NYSE: GE ), stemming from rekindled hope of a recovery, was enough to drag the broad market back into the black yesterday.
None of those names are particularly well-suited for speculative trading today, however. Rather, stock charts of Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE: IPG ), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN ) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE ) are shaping up as the best bets. Here's why, and what to look for.
Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG)
If Interpublic Group of Companies rings oddly familiar, there's a reason. It was one of the names put under the trading microscope back at the beginning of the month . At the time, it was working its way into the tip of a converging wedge pattern, but it wasn't yet clear in which direction it would be squeezed out of that pattern.
5 Marijuana Stocks to Stay Far Away From
Thanks to recent bullishness that defies the market tide, we've got some new, compelling clarity on that front.
Click to Enlarge • Thanks to Monday's relatively modest 0.2% gain from IPG shares, the stock has broken above the falling resistance line, plotted in yellow, that had been guiding it lower for weeks.
• It's not just the move above a technical ceiling though. Underscoring the nascent bullishness is the flood of buying volume that's materializes over the course of the past week and a half. The buyers appear to have tipped their hand.
• Should this breakout thrust take hold, there's a significant technical ceiling around $23.60, where Interpublic Group of Companies peaked several times last year and early this year. This resistance is plotted in blue on the weekly chart.
Devon Energy (DVN)
Devon Energy has been something of an outlier of late. Although most oil and gas stocks have at least held their ground in sync with firm natural gas and crude oil prices, DVN stock has been fighting a losing battle. That battle moved to a critical tipping point on Monday though, and the tide looks decidedly bearish.
Click to Enlarge • The tipping point in question is the $38.60, around where Devon shares hit a low not just yesterday, but last month, as well as in late June.
• Fanning the bearish flames is yesterday's cross back under the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white, against a backdrop of decidedly strong selling volume. The accumulation-distribution line has been falling faster than the stock has since early August.
• As unlikely as a trip all the way back to that level seems at this point, the weekly stock chart suggests there's something supportive about the $30 level.
Adobe Systems (ADBE)
Finally, while Adobe Systems has built an impressive business-minded software suite that drives lots of recurring revenue, this is one of those names that's arguably gotten a little ahead of itself. Over the course of the past several months it hasn't mattered. ADBE shares managed to find support when and where it needed to.
As of Monday though, those key lines in the sand are no longer keeping the selling effort at bay. One more decent drubbing and the weight of the gains since early last year may well unravel.
Click to Enlarge • The 50-day and 100-day moving average lines, plotted in purple and gray on the daily chart - respectively - have kept the bigger uptrend alive. The former's been shattered though, and the stock closed right at the latter's value yesterday.
• One has to zoom out to the weekly chart to realize it, but we've been in the shadow of a bearish MACD cross since July, and with the Chaikin line's cross below zero this week, we can confirm there's quietly been a lot of profit-taking of late already. Nobody's really buying in earnest at recent prices.
• Keep an eye on the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. If the bears continue to charge, that's the next-most-likely support level. If it fails, there's no clear picture as to where the bleeding may stop.

Recently, the company rolled out a new service called Expedia Action. This will enable users in managing their travel planning by utilizing voice usage in collaboration with Alphabet's GOOGL Google Assistant.
Notably, this will aid the company in delivering hands-free travel management experience to its users.
Moreover, this will enhance the company's key offerings which in turn will aid it in attracting more travelers to its platform. Consequently, this will bolster its market position and top-line growth.
Coming to the price performance, shares of Expedia have lost 1.9% on a year-to-date basis against the industry 's rally of 3.3%. Intensifying competition in the online travel space is affecting the company. However, its expanding services portfolio will help the stock to rebound in the long haul.
Online Travel Space Holds Promise
In this data driven world, online travel space has gained significant momentum, thanks to the increasing penetration of internet usage.
Further, growing proliferation of smartphones worldwide have made it easier for the travelers to book their flight and train tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars at vacation spot and to name a few, from anywhere just by signing into an e-commerce travel site.
Reportedly, the global travel industry is projected to witness growth of 12% over a period of 2017 to 2023.
Further, a report from Technavio suggests that the worldwide online travel booking platform market is expected to witness a CAGR of 11% between 2018 and 2022.
Robust Services to Aid Growth
We believe Expedia is well poised to reap benefits from this rapidly growing market on the back of its technical advancements and robust travel services.
With the latest move, the company aims at incorporating the immense possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technology into its core online travel business to ease the booking process for its users.
The users will be able to book as well as cancel their hotel and flight reservations, get information on packing lists for upcoming trips and access to Expedia trip itineraries with the help of voice commands from any device with Google Assistant.
Further, users will be able to track their reward points on the linkage of their Expedia accounts with the new service.
Apart from this, the company rolled out a cost saving facility for the travelers called Add-On Advantage in June. This allows the travelers to avail discounts up to 43 percent on hotel bookings.

It's a case of tough love for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) shares right now. But if you're willing to look past today's bear market warnings and a more bullish, albeit potentially volatile big picture, then a creative spread combination looks like the right option to play.
Let me explain.
To say AMD stock had a tough session Wednesday, may be the understatement of the year. Shares of Advanced Micro spiraled lower by 8.22% on more than 147 million shares. But if misery loves company, AMD also wasn't alone.
The ""clueless"" and widespread panic, which took AMD along for the ride was punctuated by the Dow Jones' sensationalist but still dizzying 832 point decline. The price route was triggered with nary a single fresh catalyst. But let's face it, it also wasn't without existing ammo for bears to take a swipe at market bulls with.
So where do we go from here in AMD stock? As the S&P 500's top performing stock of 2018 and virtually its entire 143% year-to-date gains coming in less than six months, it has also made AMD stock one of the most talked about and unequivocally, most actively traded growth stocks in the market.
Bearing in mind AMD stock's position within the market - one which also has a legion of bears and short interest in excess of 20% - Wednesday's volatile price swoon in AMD stock is simply the nasty byproduct of momentum turning into its own worst enemy and bears flaunting a victory within a losing battle.
17 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double
The pressured price action Advanced Micro Devices is currently feeling is nothing new. The fact is the greatest growth stocks from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or even Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) have had their share of divisive critics and taken lumps at times before soaring to even higher highs.
So, if you're like me and believe in the longer-term narrative and proven stewardship of Advanced Micro Devices under Lisa Su, then it's time to buy, buy, buy … well sorta.
AMD Stock Monthly Chart
It's official. As of Wednesday's close, AMD stock is in bear territory. It sounds scary enough. And by the looks of it, a monthly chart sporting a potentially ominous candlestick topping pattern only reinforces a situation that doesn't appear forgiving to today's would-be bulls. Still, there is good news to be found.
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices are now off 27% from their recent high. As investors familiar with growth stocks are or should be aware, this type of corrective action is par for the course. And what that ultimately means is the current situation is typically closer to being a better opportunity to buy growth at a discount than concerning oneself within a minor setback and temporary bear market label.
AMD Stock Bullish Spread Combination
Despite being bullish on AMD's long-term prospects and given a correction of this size, it is likely within 5% to 10% of finding a meaningful bottom. I'm not a glutton for punishment and don't enjoy buying stocks blindly or as a standalone position. Having said that, a limited and reduced risk options position to gain bullish exposure in Advanced Micro Devices makes sense.
Reviewing Advanced Micro Devices options and shares at $25, I'm favoring a combination which purchases the asymmetrical Jan $27 / $32 / $34 call butterfly and sells the Jan $23 / $21 put spread for a debit of 35 cents.
Downside exposure is contained to $2.35 or 9.4% of owning AMD stock with this offbeat spread package. That's nice protection in a volatile name. Even better, the break-even at expiration is $23.35.
That's 6.6% below current levels. Furthermore, the maximum risk is 16% beneath today's $25 price in AMD and would require a slightly larger-than-normal corrective move of 38%. In our view, having a paper loss at those levels in AMD stock is where traders should be greedy, not fearful and would be a good spot to begin building a longer-term position in shares.
3 Cybersecurity Stocks for These Fearful Times
On the upside, if AMD is able to regain its footing from today's corrective activity, i.e., bear market, on an expiration basis, then the play begins to profit above $27.35. That's just under 10% from Wednesday's close. But if shares rally sooner, this modified butterfly will quickly balloon in value due to its asymmetrical configuration.
In a perfect world, AMD stock will rally to $32 on the third Friday of January and allow profits to approach $4.65 or a return in excess of 1,300%. But unlike a traditional long butterfly this position retains $2.65 above $34, just in case cooler, but more aggressive heads prevail in this secular growth story.

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 2.06% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 2.13%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.25%.
Heading into today, shares of the software maker had lost 11.16% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 6.61% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.01% in that time.
ADBE will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be December 13, 2018. On that day, ADBE is projected to report earnings of $1.88 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 49.21%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.42 billion, up 20.77% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.80 per share and revenue of $8.99 billion. These totals would mark changes of +57.77% and +23.12%, respectively, from last year.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for ADBE should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.78% higher. ADBE is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
In terms of valuation, ADBE is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 35. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 31.23, which means ADBE is trading at a premium to the group.
We can also see that ADBE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.13. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.12 as of yesterday's close.
The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 93, putting it in the top 36% of all 250+ industries.

Let's call a spade a spade: it's been the unexpected revival of a left-for-dead Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) that's made life miserable for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) shareholders of late. Although Intel stock was up as much as 24% for the year as of June, another batch of new products from AMD has taken the Intel stock price from more than $57 to less than $46.
10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy for the Long Term
It's not just AMD that gets the credit/blame, though. Although Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long been a fan of Intel's modems and connectivity tech for its iPhones, the buzz is that Apple won't be tapping Intel to supply Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips for the version of the smartphone expected to launch in 2020 after all. In the meantime, Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) has reportedly lapped Intel in the broad semiconductor market.
They're just the kind of scandalous headlines investors of all sorts not only love to circulate, but embellish as they do so. It's the embellishment, in fact, that's been so problematic for INTC stock of late.
What if, however, all the rumors of Intel's irrelevancy and failure to innovate were just that - rumors?
As it turns out, Intel isn't quite as dead in the water as the headlines would have you believe. Its newest three products make the point.
1. 5G
Apple may not be in love with Intel's near-field connectivity tech for 2020's iPhones, but Apple has long been a fan of Intel's modems, and should continue to lean heavily on Intel going forward on that front. The newly unveiled iPhone XS sports an Intel modem and there's a chance Intel could meet the vast majority of Apple's 5G modem needs come 2019.
It's not just Apple, though.
As fast as the race to 5G connectivity is being run in North America, China is racing even faster to that finish line. And Intel is helping to make it happen. It's working with China's UNISOC Technologies , H3C, Comba Telecom and even Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), positioning itself as a go-to 5G solutions provider in that important market.
2. i9 Processor
Several months ago, an i9 processor was more of a dream and less of a product. Intel's i7 was as good as it practically got.
Not anymore, though. The company's ninth-generation is almost here and the most premium version of it - the i9-9900K - is a beast. Sporting eight cores and sixteen threads , it hums along at a base speed of 3.6 GHz, but can be boosted up to 5.0 GHz. Intel calls it the best gaming CPU ever - and it probably is. And, reasonably priced at $488, hardcore gamers may well take the plunge. Performance-oriented computer users will be just as pleased with lesser versions of the i9.
3. Vision Accelerator
The term ""vision accelerator"" may not mean much to the average consumer/investor, but to artificial intelligence developers, it means a great deal.
Vision acceleration is a way of processing more visual data faster. Though sensors can ""see"" colors and shapes and even figure out distances, computers still aren't as good as the human eye when it comes to figuring out what something is and how far away it is.
Intel took a big step in closing that gap, however, recently unveiling its family of Vision Accelerator Design Products . These tools can be utilized in a variety of artificial intelligence applications ranging from smart cities to defect-detection and more. It's a sliver of the AI industry that's only started to gel.
Looking Ahead for Intel Stock
It's an impressive lineup to be sure, though one can't help but wonder: If Intel is doing so many different things, can it do any of them particularly well?
Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore thinks so. He wrote just a few days ago : ""The company's focus on expanding the scope to 'data centric' businesses makes cost cutting difficult and arguably can distract from the core business,"" adding, ""While we can see the arguments for both, we see renewing focus on the core as a lower-risk path to upside.""
His point is well taken, and given the recent pullback from Intel stock, investors at least partially agree.
This is a case, however, where smart investors may want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture - and look at Intel's competencies. Yes, it got caught with its proverbial pants down by AMD. This is the same Intel that largely defined the computing market we know today. Money and know-how aren't the problem. The overarching problem is time - Intel needs more of it.
7 Consumer Stocks to Sell Now
Thing is, Intel stock is apt to move higher again well before it proves all of its top projects right now will pay off. This is still a forward-looking game, even if the market's temporarily forgotten it.
As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter , at @jbrumley.

The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 4.86%.
In the last reported quarter, PayPal's earnings of 58 cents per share grew 28% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% sequentially. The figure also delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.57%.
Net revenues increased 23% year over year and 4.6% sequentially to $3.86 billion beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 billion.
Improving total active accounts on the back of expanding customer base drove year-over-year growth. Moreover, Moreover, the company's growing number of strategic acquisitions and robust performance of Choice remained positive throughout the quarter to be reported.
For third-quarter 2018, PayPal expects revenues between $3.62 billion and $3.67 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to lie within the range of 53-55 cents per diluted share.
Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.
Key Metrics to Consider
Active customer accounts and total payment volume (""TPV"") forms the basis of PayPal's business. The company has been witnessing massive growth in these two metrics over the past several quarters.
For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for active customer accounts is pegged at 251, which shows year-over-year growth of 15.1%. Further, the consensus estimate for TPV is projected at $145.03 billion, reflecting an improvement of 27.2% from the year-ago quarter.
PayPal is currently riding on its well-performing Venmo, Choice and One Touch which are aiding the expansion of its customer base. Further, strengthening presence in theglobal marketand strategic partnerships are major positives.
Additionally, strengthening merchant base and rapidly increasing mobile payment volume driven by growing penetration of smartphone and internet usage globally are driving the adoption rate of the company's payment solutions.
All these factors have led to the upswing in the above mentioned metrics.

Strategic Partnerships to Drive Growth
In the to-be-reported quarter, the company entered into quite a few strategic partnerships which are likely to drive the upcoming quarterly results.
During the third quarter, PayPal extended its partnership with Uber to make its Venmo available to the Uber customers which will ensure seamless payment for the rides and foods. This remains positive for the growing adoption rate of Venmo.
Further, the company's international money transfer service called Xoom teamed up with TransNetwork to enable its U.S. customers in sending money to their family and friends at any OXXO location in Mexico.
Additionally, Xoom partnered with Euronet Worldwide's subsidiary Ria which will bolster the company's presence in Easter Europe and Africa. This partnership will enable Xoom customers to avail cash pick up facility at 150,000 of Ria's international network locations.
Moreover, the company's partnership with MasterCard continues to aid the adoption rate of Venmo. Further, its extended tie-up with Alphabet's GOOGL Google and eBay EBAY will continue to bolster its momentum.
We believe all these strong endeavors will keep strengthening the customer base of the company which in turn is likely to drive its top-line growth.

The past week has been quite eventful for NVIDIA. Swedish automaker Volvo Cars chose NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Xavier platform, an advanced car computer, to be incorporated in its next-generation automated cars.
Moreover, Oracle ORCL chose to support NVIDIA HGX-2 platform on its Cloud Infrastructure to address growing demand for AI and machine learning across various industries.
However, major highlight of the week is the launch of open-source GPU-acceleration platform, RAPIDS, which is designed to enable companies to analyze a huge amount of data at unparalleled speed and make business decisions efficiently. This technology aims to accelerate data science pipelines significantly by transferring workflows onto graphics processing units (GPUs), optimizing machine learning training.
Notably, Oracle also announced that RAPIDS will be available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure this week.
NVIDIA's Efforts Paying Off
Advancements in AI and high performance computing (HPC) involve immense complexity and demand robust computing power. NVIDIA's powerful technologies are designed to cater to these needs, driving major companies to select NVIDIA as their technology partner for ambitious projects.
Growing traction of AI among industries - including transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities, and healthcare - is benefiting NVIDIA.The company's AI inference solution is helping it expand its total addressable market.
NVIDIA's foray into autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space has been driving its stock since mid-2015. The company launched powerful AI supercomputer chips and partnered with premium carmakers, which are aiding its Automotive revenues.
With sustained focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-driving cars, we believe that the company is well poised to grow in the driverless vehicle technology space.
Moreover, NVIDIA's focus on GRID platforms is increasing GPU adoption in data centers, giving it an advantage over its competitors. We believe that NVIDIA's GRID enterprise virtual graphics, which improve visual effects of games, will aid its revenue and margin growth.

Competition Intensifies
AI-enabled chip-making has attractive prospects. Per IDC, global spending on AI Systems is expected to reach $77.6 billion in 2022. This also means that competition among major chipmakers will strengthen, with advancements in AI and machine learning.
Recently, in a bid to get out of the dependence on large semiconductor manufacturers, Huawei Technologies launched two AI chips, serving datacenters and smart devices.
Also, beside its partnership with NVIDIA, IBM tied up with more than 100 companies - including Google - through its OpenPower project, with intention of building an ecosystem around its Power chips. IBM's chip architecture already supports big data and HPC workloads.
NVIDIA is already facing major competition from Advanced Micro Devices AMD in graphic chip-making for the PC market after Intel INTC , another major competitor, partnered with AMD for an 8th gen chip.
Nonetheless, continuous product launches in the computing segment and increasing demand for NVIDIA's graphics chips and technologies are positives for the company, which are likely to help it maintain its stronghold in the intensely competitive AI-driven chip market.
NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It's important not to overreact to the recent declines in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock. Long-term, I still believe Nvidia stock is a buy. Short-term, it has been a different story. Nvidia stock has fallen 18% in just the last eight trading sessions before today.
There are some external factors behind the weakness of Nvidia stock. Most notably, it has been a risk-off market of late, with tech high-flyers like Square (NYSE: SQ ) and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ) slumping. And the semiconductor space in particular has taken a pounding. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has pulled back about 20% from its late September levels. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) had already sold off before the market's slump and is nearing an eight-month low. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) has fallen more than 10% in less than two weeks.
The selloff in chip names seems centered around one key question: is this time different? The good news for NVDA stock is that it still looks as if it is.
7 Stocks to Buy and Hold Through Any Market Selloff
Chip Stocks Haven't Always Been High-Flyers
It's perhaps easy to forget amid the huge, recent gains in stocks like NVDA and AMD, but historically the semiconductor sector has been a lousy place in which to put capital. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, available in ETF form as the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX ), traded near $70 in 2002. It wouldn't reach those levels again for over eleven years . Nvidia stock itself went from a $16 peak in 2002 to $20 at the beginning of 2015; that's an average annual gain of less than 2%.
The problem is - or perhaps was - that the semiconductor business is not a particularly attractive one. In the sector, products have to improve continually to keep with the pace of innovation (this concept is often explained as Moore's Law ). At the same time, chip prices generally come down over time. And traditionally, the industry has been cyclical (Micron still is cyclical ). Chip makers' margins have been low, and their capital spending levels have traditionally been high. Finally, their earnings usually don't grow in a straight line -and can plunge seemingly at a moment's notice.
For all those reasons, semiconductor stocks - with rare exceptions - historically have received below-market multiples. Even Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), until recently the world's largest chip maker (it's now second behind Samsung ), was pretty much dead money for a decade after the dot-com bust. (It still hasn't returned to its 2000 peaks or really come close to them.) The chip sector was not an attractive place to be, particularly for growth investors.
NVDA Stock Takes Off And So Does the Sector
That has obviously changed in the last few years. Starting in late 2012, the SOX index doubled in less than three years. After selling off a bit, it doubled from its February 2016 lows in less than two years. Nvidia stock has been a key contributor to the sector's rebound. Somewhat incredibly, even after the recent selloff, NVDA stock has risen 1,420% in the last five years.
But NVDA wasn't the only driver. A key reason for the gains in semiconductor stocks has been that investors increasingly believe that secular growth drivers - autonomous driving, cloud computing, Internet of Things - can offset, at least to some extent, the industry's cyclical nature. (Stifel analyst Patrick Ho detailed that argument back in late 2016.) And so the growth of Nvidia and AMD isn't destined to come crashing to a halt at some indeterminate point in the future. Intel and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) may be in the same boat.
That argument rests on what often is one of the most dangerous premises in investing: that ""this time is different."" And what has happened of late is that investors aren't buying that argument anymore. Equipment makers Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ) and Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX ) - which Stifel's Ho said weren't cyclical anymore - are plunging, amid fears of weaker and/or delayed orders. Micron is back near its recent lows. And the weakness is bleeding over to Nvidia stock.
This Time Might Not Be Different, But Nvidia Stock Is Different
To be honest, I do think the bear thesis on chip companies has some merit. But when it comes to NVDA, there's an important distinction to make. Nvidia isn't just any semiconductor company. It's absolutely dominant in gaming, in which demand is largely consumer-driven. Secular trends there look intact. Macro weakness could cause demand to decline at some point, since Nvidia-based systems aren't cheap. Traditional semiconductor cycles, however, aren't really in play.
Data center growth probably won't slow down, and there, too, cyclical concerns don't apply. The same is true of the professional visualization business. Nvidia's automotive opportunity remains a few years off, but that category accounted for just 5% of the company's first-half revenue.
The market is acting as if historical semiconductor cyclicality is returning and will take Nvidia down with it. The former scenario is possible, but the latter scenario seems unlikely. NVDA can maintain its growth even without cyclical help. And if it does maintain its growth, Nvidia stock can easily recapture its recent losses, and could even rise beyond that level.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +30%.
Revenues are expected to be $1.71 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17.73% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Advanced Micro?
For Advanced Micro, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.67%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination indicates that Advanced Micro will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Advanced Micro would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of +16.67%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Advanced Micro appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMD options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $23.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.47. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $23.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $20.53 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $23.69/share today.
Because the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.74% return on the cash commitment, or 67.53% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $23.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $24.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.76. If an investor was to purchase shares of AMD stock at the current price level of $23.69/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $24.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.96% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AMD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AMD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $24.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $24.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 11.65% boost of extra return to the investor, or 73.27% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 78%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 77%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $23.69) to be 53%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Let's take a look at what caused the heavy losses.
US-Sino Trade War
Trade disputes between the United States and China have been posing threats to the sector. The Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinese goods worth of $200 billion starting Sep 24. The tariffs started at 10% but will shoot up to 25% on Jan 1, 2019. Before this, Trump had enacted 25% tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods (read: US-Sino Trade War Escalates: Most Vulnerable Sector ETFs ).
Semiconductor is one of the vulnerable sectors out of this trade war. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, ""semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52% "" and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs ).
Chipmaker Qualcomm QCOM has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia's sales exposure to China is 56% , per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55% , include IntelINTC , Micron Technology MU and Applied Materials AMAT . This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space and why SMH is in deep trouble (read: US-Sino Trade War Escalates: Most Vulnerable Sector ETFs ).
Downbeat Earnings Guidance
Gloomy earnings guidance from a few industry behemoths deepened the gloom. Some of the companies that added to the market jitters were Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingTSM (down 4% on Oct 24) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.AMD (down 9.2% on Oct 24). Advanced Micro Devices' revenues also fell below theguidance . Industry bellwethers like STMicroelectronics STM (down 13.8% on Oct 24) also cautioned about the future weakness, per an article published on seeking alpha.
Overvaluation Concerns
Many analysts believe that super-rich valuations of tech companies are getting adjusted amid market turmoil. Since tech stocks are high-flying, analysts are setting their models in line with the rising rate expectations. In early October, Raymond James lowered its 2019 earnings estimates for eight chip stocks, expecting companies to see weakness in business activity, per an article published on CNBC. The firm also cut its view for several chip stocks in late September, citing a ""cyclical downturn"" in the sector.
What Lies Ahead for Semiconductor ETFs?
Since several analysts are flagging concerns over the sector, investors should be cautious about semiconductor investing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cautioned about supply and pricing issues weighing on memory chipmakers could deteriorate in 2019.
So, investors who are skeptical about semiconductor investing may consider inverse semiconductor ETFs like Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x SharesSOXS (up 60.1% in the past month) and ProShares Ultra Short SemiconductorsSSG (up 36.7% in the past month) (see all Technology ETFs here).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

This October is certainly living up to its frightening moniker. For investors in semiconductor superstar, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ), these days are feeling a bit like déjà vu. And not in a good way. Shares of AMD stock have basically been cut in half over the last two months- accelerating downward in the recent tech meltdown and throughout this earnings season.
That's a pain long-term AMD stockholders know all too well.
Perhaps the scariest part is that AMD's current woes seem awfully familiar to those woes that plagued the firm during the dot-com bust and resulting meltdown. Rivals are coming at them in a big way and sales of key products are slipping.
10 Large-Cap Stocks That Are Already Rebounding
The question now is whether or not this is just a big scare for AMD, or if its recent plunges are the start of something a bit more sinister.
Big Gains & Bad News for AMD Stock
It's hard to imagine, but AMD has been one of tech's rising stars this year. Shares surged roughly 230% over the last eight months. The reason is that AMD finally got its mojo back and began to innovate like there was no tomorrow.
The semiconductor firm moved managed to strike CPU gold with its successful ZEN chips back in 2016. From there, Advanced Micro Devices RYZEN chipset has become immensely popular with consumers due to their high performance for low price points.
At the same time, AMD's EPYC series has quickly taken market share in the vital server and cloud computing space. And with the continued need for advanced imagining in industries like healthcare, engineering and science, graphics processing unit (GPU) demand has surged.
A hefty dose of bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining hasn't hurt either. This has only strengthened the bullish case for Advanced Micro Devices further. AMD stock heated up as investors looked at the turnaround and saw much improvement.
Then the bottom seemed to drop out for AMD. Back in mid-September, good news began to swirl around rival chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). A research report from BlueFin Research Partners suggested that INTC's production problems of its state-of-the-art 10-nanometer processors may not be as bad as feared.
At the same time, Intel managed to send improved guidance and boosted EPS numbers for its latest reported quarter. That alone managed to send AMD stock plunging. But for Advanced Micro Devices it got worse. Much worse.
On the surface, its latest earnings call was pretty good. AMD managed to report third-quarter revenue of $1.65 billion. This was up 4% when looking at year over year comparisons.
The problem is this was $50 million short of the analyst's estimates. More important, it was significantly lower (a 6% drop) than the second quarter's numbers and its revenue growth rate was down 53% as well.
The drop could be attributed to lower demand/pricing for those critical GPUs. So much so, AMD cut guidance numbers for the fourth quarter. With that investors were looking for the exits. The stock is down now more than 50%.
A Big Problem For AMD?
It's easy to underway why investors have started to dump AMD shares in mass. If you remember, the reason for Advanced Micro Devices' original fall from grace came down to rivals winning in a declining sales environment.
Thanks to better chipsets and licensing deals, Intel became the dominate semiconductors found in PCs. When the personal computing bust happened, AMD was sunk.
This sounds an awful lot like today. INTC is still dominating PC/server sales and its 10-nanometer processors will continue to gain/keep market share in the sector. At the same time, GPU demand is waning- partly because of the cryptocurrency bust.
Here again, AMD is a distant second fiddle to leader NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and NVDA also provided lower guidance numbers back in August .
History has a strange way of repeating itself. The question is whether or not this actually happening at Advanced Micro Devices.
Like fellow InvestorPlace contributors Vince Martin and Luke Lango, I happen to think that the story at AMD was one-part rampant speculation and one-part actual real numbers. Advanced Micro Devices was once a $2-per-share stock. In it's run up to over $30 per share, investors continued to place more and more on shares. Some of that was clearly wishful thinking and pure speculation.
The other part is based on some decent growth. Both sales of Ryzen PC CPUs and EPYC server CPUs have continued to grow. More important, Lango notes that AMD managed to score some major cloud computing contracts with heavy-weights Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Dropbox (NASDAQ: DBX ), and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ).
At the same time, margins remain robust and the firm is still set to record more than $1.45 billion of revenue over the fourth quarter. That's still an 8% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
The reality is, the story at AMD remains pretty much intact. The potentially overvalued story before is not.
Watch AMD Stock
With that, AMD stock is very much a watchlist candidate. I expect the markets and tech stocks, in particular, to be pretty volatile over the next few weeks.
For investors that could give them a chance to snag shares at a more reasonable, if not bargain price. At a forward P/E of 36x, Advance Micro seems pretty fairly valued when looking at the tech sector.
All in all, the growth story is there and now, investors can actually play it versus just pinning it only on hopes.
As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

TTGT is slated to release third-quarter 2018 results on Nov 7.
Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 22.7%.
In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded year-over-year improvement on both counts.
In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings of 21 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents and were way higher than the year-ago quarter's figure of 9 cents.
Revenues of $31.5 million matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew 18% from the year-ago quarter.
For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $30.9 million, indicating year-over-year improvement of 10.3%.
Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 18 cents, which is 63.6% higher than the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.
Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.
Factors to Consider
TechTarget's focus on all its businesses is yielding positive results. However, the company's flagship product Priority Engine, within its IT Deal Alert suite of products, is the key growth driver.
In the last reported quarter, revenues from IT Deal products witnessed 21% year-over-year growth backed by Priority Engine solution, which increased nearly 60% year over year.
On the other hand, revenues from Core Online increased 16% on a year-over-year basis, driven by 20% growth in North America and 10% in the international market. Better-than-expected growth in Core Online offerings was a key driver.
Moreover, the shift to longer-term subscription model bodes well for TechTarget. In the second quarter, 34% of the company's revenues were attributed to longer-term subscription revenue compared with 21% in the year-ago quarter.
Additionally, the company is benefiting from a healthy IT spending environment, which is resulting in improved budget of customers.

What Our Model Says
According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP . Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
TechTarget currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:
Adobe Systems Incorporated ADBE with an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Etsy Inc. ETSY with an Earnings ESP of +76.27% and a Zacks Rank #2.
Five9, Inc. FIVN with an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies
It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation Quote
Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming earnings release.
Factors Likely to Impact Q3
Monster Beverage has been witnessing solid momentum in the energy category amid a tepid beverage industry. The company offers a wide range of energy drink brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster and Worx Energy among others. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola's energy drink brands to the company's portfolio strengthened its position in the global energy drinks market. Moreover, the company's top line is poised to benefit from its product innovation strategy and regular product launches.
In the second quarter of 2018, management launched Monster Energy brand with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Belarus, Tanzania and Uruguay, beside relaunching the brand with a Coca-Cola bottler in certain cities across India. Monster Beverage plans for more international launches in 2018. Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its energy drinks category to continue gaining momentum, owing to Monster Energy, Monster Hydro and Mutant drinks. Latest additions to the Monster brand are expected to generate incremental sales and boost profitability.
This apart, Monster Beverage remains optimistic about product benefits from the broader distribution network as a result of the Coca-Cola deal. In fact, the company has been expanding its international operations into a variety of new markets, including China, India, African and the Middle Eastern countries. Evidently, net sales to customers outside the United States were up 18.5% in the second quarter of 2018.
All these initiatives are expected to boost the company's top line in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $990.8 million, reflecting an increase of 8.9% year over year. Moreover, the stock gained 1.5% in the last six months against the industry 's 1.3% decline.
However, higher raw material costs, mainly aluminum; and unfavorable product mix continue to remain hurdles. This, in turn, might dent the company's margins in the upcoming quarter. Further, softness in the beverage industry due to growing consciousness regarding health and wellness is hurting performance. Further, better beverage alternatives like ready-to-drink tea and bottled water, as well as the shift in consumer preferences have been impacting volumes of sodas and energy drinks.
Zacks Model
Our proven model shows that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings estimates in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +3.01% and a Zacks Rank #3, making us confident of an earnings beat.
Other Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are some other companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat:
Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB has an Earnings ESP of +8.74% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. NUS has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

Prior to today's trading, shares of the chipmaker had lost 27.18% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 8.65% and the S&P 500's loss of 6.76% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from AMD as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 29, 2019. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.09, up 12.5% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.45 billion, down 1.78% from the year-ago period.
AMD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.46 per share and revenue of $6.54 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +170.59% and +22.65%, respectively.

Shares of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) declined 13.5% in October, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence . For perspective, the S&P 500 was down 6.91%.
TXN data by YCharts .
The stock was in positive territory year to date through the month of August, but it started to fall along with the broader market in September. The stock's decline began to snowball after management issued weak guidance during the company's third-quarter earnings report in late October.
So what
Texas Instruments' reported solid third-quarter operating results. Revenue met expectations, growing 4% year over year to $4.3 billion. Earnings per share beat Wall Street's expectations by surging 25% to $1.58 per share. However, management's fourth-quarter guidance of revenue between $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion was lower than the $4 billion analysts were expecting. Investors didn't like the sound of that, which sent the shares down 8.22% immediately following the news.
Vice President David Pahl said, ""demand for our products slowed across most markets during the quarter."" Pahl attributed weak demand to the broader semiconductor market slowing down after several years of growth. Other companies in the industry, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ: CY) , also reported weakness in demand, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) showed strength in its latest quarter.
Now what
The Philadelphia semiconductor index has soared 147% over the last five years, which is well ahead of the S&P 500's return of 54%. Texas Instruments and other chip makers have seen booming demand for processors from the automotive and industrial markets in recent years, driving those impressive gains.
The performance of semiconductor companies is seen as a forward indicator for how the broader economy is performing since processors are used in several industries across consumer electronics, mobile devices, home appliances, cars, factories, and many other applications. This is one reason investors were so quick to bail on shares of Texas Instruments after it gave a weak outlook.
Intel's strong quarter seemed to ease concerns for the time being, with most chip stocks rebounding since Intel reported its results in late October. It's possible that Texas Instruments may just be experiencing a temporary slowdown before demand picks up again. It's also worth noting that the uncertainty surrounding the mid-term elections may have something to do with weakening demand in the short term.
We'll know more when Texas Instruments reports its fourth-quarter earnings early next year.

Election day was unsurprisingly tame, with most investors willing to wait at least one more day to make trades so they can make some decisions in light of who is (or isn't) in office. The S&P 500 finished the session at 2755.45, up 0.63% for the day.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) did a great deal of the heavy-lifting, gaining 3.9% mostly on reports that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) was opting to use its Epyc server chips to support its cloud computing services. Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL ) was the day's big winner though, rallying more than 16% after posting third-quarter numbers that handily exceeded expectations .
There were losers too. Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) fell 4% before posting its third-quarter numbers after the closing bell rang. That turned out to be a big mistake though. ETSY shares were up 12% in after-hours trading thanks to a big earnings beat .
As for today's top trading prospects, none of those names look all that inviting. Rather, it's stock charts of Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) and PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG ) that rise to the top of the heap. Here's why, and what's apt to happen next … and what has to happen next.
Walt Disney (DIS)
With just a quick glance at the daily chart, Walt Disney is clearly making forward progress, but not in a straight line. No big deal. Stocks ebb and flow. It's just part of the process.
10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Black Friday
When one takes a step back and looks at the longer-term weekly chart of DIS though, it becomes clear there's more going on here than just a little bit of volatility. After months of churning, it's clear that Disney shares are in a whole new groove that bodes very bullishly.
Click to Enlarge • The weekly chart isn't tough to interpret. Walt Disney shares had been trapped in a converging wedge pattern since 2016, but just within the past several weeks broke above the upper boundary of that range.
• Though there are more (and bigger) ""up"" days than ""down"" days, the ebb and flow here has become pretty reliable. It's unlikely we'll see more straight line action in the future.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)
It's been since August that we last looked at Skyworks Solutions . But, nothing's changed in the meantime. The problems it was facing then it's still facing now, and with a little more of the same, SWKS could slip even deeper into trouble.
There's also a chance that its sheer oversold condition could set the stage for a bounce. Somehow though, given the bearish momentum in place, that's a slim chance.
Click to Enlarge • The downtrend is still clearly intact, on both the weekly and the daily stock charts. Since August, the chart's blue 20-day and purple 50-day moving average lines have helped keep the selling in motion.
• A test of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line at $78.50 appears imminent. If that line fails to hold up as a floor, there's little that will be able to hold the next prospective wave of selling back.
• Notice on the daily chart how the recent selloff days have unfurled on above-average volume, while the ""up"" days have been on light volume.
PG&E Corporation (PCG)
Last but not least, back in mid-September stock charts of PG&E Corporation made their way onto traders' radars, and for good reason. PCG was knocking on the door of a major technical ceiling around $49, which had kept a breakout at bay since April. Several bullish crosses of key moving averages had just taken shape, and the undertow looked almost perfect for a breakout. It clearly wasn't perfect though … at least not yet. That breakout move faded, forcing the bulls to regroup.
They have regrouped though, and as of Tuesday the possibility of a breakout move is back on the table.
Click to Enlarge • The technical ceiling in question is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. It's now been tested five, and arguably six times. So far it's not been snapped, but the steadily higher lows speak volumes.
• Also speaking volumes is the divergence of the moving average lines seen since the bullish crossovers from September.
• If the technical hurdle at $49 is finally breached, notice there's no meaningful prior peak that's apt to serve as the next technical ceiling until you get back to last year's highs around $70.

The company surpassed estimates only once in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive earnings surprise of 0.14%. Notably, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 58.33% in the second-quarter 2018.
Shares of JD.com have lost 43.1% on a year-to-date basis against the industry 's rally of 1%.
Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.
E-Commerce Business to Aid Growth
In the second quarter, net revenues from online direct sales increased 29.4% from the prior-year quarter to RMB110.5 billion (US$16.7 billion). It accounted for 91% of the total second-quarter sales. The upsurge was driven by demand for home appliances, food and beverage, cosmetics, home furnishing and baby products.
The company continues to invest in order to expand its fulfillment capability and enhance product offerings. Further, its warehouses and robust transportation system are anticipatedto continue aidinggrowth to its e-commerce business.
Further, JD.com's strong endeavors toward expanding footprint in the e-commerce markets outside China are major positives.The company continues to invest in relatively nascent and emerging markets. Additionally, the company's partnership with Alphabet's division Google is likely to continue bolstering presence in the international market.
All these factors are likely to drive the company's third-quarter results.
Other Factors to Consider
The company's growing advertising initiatives remain positives. Moreover, the well-performing text-driven advertising products are expected to aid the company's advertising revenues in the to-be reported quarter.
Further, strengtheningsupply chain management system bodes well for the company's logistics unit. However, sluggishness in the third party logistics services unit remains a concern.
Additionally, slowing home appliances market poses threat to the company's online sales. Further, ongoing weakness in the smartphone market is a headwind. Further, macroeconomic headwinds in China are major negatives.

What Our Model Says
According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .
JD.com has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +37.50%. Such a combination makes surprise prediction difficult.
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some stocks worth considering as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver anearnings beat in the upcoming releases.
Adobe Systems ADBE has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Box BOX has an Earnings ESP of +5.41% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Semtech Corporation SMTC has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.
It's not the one you think.

For the First Trust Dorsey Wright People's Portfolio ETF (Symbol: DWPP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $33.35 per unit.
With DWPP trading at a recent price near $29.17 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.33% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DWPP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are BorgWarner Inc (Symbol: BWA), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (Symbol: AMD), and Masco Corp. (Symbol: MAS). Although BWA has traded at a recent price of $40.22/share, the average analyst target is 31.98% higher at $53.08/share. Similarly, AMD has 30.90% upside from the recent share price of $21.84 if the average analyst target price of $28.59/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MAS to reach a target price of $40.69/share, which is 29.22% above the recent price of $31.49. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of BWA, AMD, and MAS:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

SQ plummeted 9% during regular trading hours Thursday after the company reported its quarterly financial results after the closing bell on Wednesday. The fintech firm topped both top and bottom-line estimates, but some lower-than-expected guidance sent SQ stock tumbling.
Despite its post-Q3 drop, Square appears to be a strong company and its stock seems like it has great upside potential in an industry that is only set to grow.
Quick Q3 Overview
Square saw its quarterly revenues soar 51% from $585.2 million to reach $882.1 million, which came in well above our Zacks Consensus Estimate that called for $860.52 million. Meanwhile, the company's adjusted quarterly earnings reached $0.13 per share. This marked an 86% surge from the year-ago period's $0.07 per share and topped our $0.11 per share estimate.
Looking ahead, the company now expects to see its full-year revenues reach between $3.26 billion and $3.27 billion, up from its previous $3.19 billion to $3.22 billion. The midpoint of Square's outlook represents a 60% climb from fiscal 2017. Plus, the company raised its fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $250 million and $255 million, up from $240 million to $250 million.
Investors were likely worried that Square projected that its adjusted Q4 earnings will come in between $0.12 to $0.13 per share, which fell short of our $0.15 estimate. Yet, the company raised the low end of its full-year earnings guidance. Plus, Square, which technically reported its first-ever quarter of GAAP profitably fueled by a $38 million positive impact from its Eventbrite investment, now expects a smaller full-year loss.
Other Positives?
Square's gross payment volume jumped 29% to reach $22.5 billion, which matched our estimate. Another key company metric, subscription and services-based revenues, skyrocketed 155% from $65 million in the year-ago period to hit $166 million. This topped our $152.62 million estimate, driven by Instant Deposit, Cash Card, Caviar, and Square Capital.
Investors should also note that Square reports bitcoin revenue, after the firm began to allow users to buy bitcoin through its Cash App late last year. The company's Q3 bitcoin revenues reached $42.9 million, up from $37 million in Q2. For the first nine months of the year, Square generated a total of $114.1 million in bitcoin revenue, or roughly 4% of its total $2.37 billion 2018 revenues.
Square didn't provide any significant Cash App updates, but mentioned that it remains one of the top 25 downloaded free apps in the App Store. ""We do see people use the Cash App fundamentally as you would expect them to use a bank account,"" CEO and Twitter TWTR co-founder Jack Dorsey said on the company's conference call.
""So they'd store money with this. They can direct deposit a paycheck using the ABA number that we give them. We can issue them a plastic card that's accepted anywhere, Visa V .""
Outlook
Square has soared since going public in the fall of 2015 as it continues to expand its business. The company, which competes against PayPal PYPL and others, now offers everything from peer-to-peer payment options to small business loans. The San Francisco-based firm's lending unit landed a deal with eBay EBAY that will see the company offer loans to eBay sellers. More recently, Square introduce a mobile version of its payroll platform to take on the likes of Paychex PAYX .
The company also highlighted its Q3 launch of Square Terminal on its conference call. Square's new all-in-one payment processor doesn't require users to connect their Square credit card readers to an iPhone AAPL or other devices. Square seems very confident in the long-term benefit of this new product.
Bottom Line
Investors should understand that Square is a significant player in the ever-growing fintech world that has the likes of JPMorgan JPM and other banking giants clamoring to offer more digital options.
Looking ahead, Square projects to post Q4 revenues between $895 million and $905 million, which comes in well above our current $891.06 million estimate and would mark a 59% surge from Q4 of 2017 at the midpoint.
Plus, we should note that SQ stock closed regular trading Thursday at $75.23 per share, down roughly 25% from its 52-week high of $101.15. This sets up what could prove to be a great buying point for investors.

In the last reported quarter, the company's loss per share of 31 cents was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents.
Let's see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.
Factors at Play
Canopy Growth once again is likely to generate a strong top-line contribution from the medical cannabis market in Canada and around the world wherein it holds a leading position. Notably, the company'sSpectrum Cannabis operations are spread in 11 countries across five continents. Of late, the company made a series of strategic acquisitions in Columbia, Lesotho and Czech Republic, which in turn, should help drive its top line.
Canopy Growth Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
Canopy Growth Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Canopy Growth Corporation Quote
The company is currently trying to establish cannabis in the world medical market by focusing on research, product development and innovative production capabilities. We are currently looking forward to the company's progress with its major cannabinoid CBD and THC. Per the company, it is producing cannabis oil products with different ratios of THC and CBD in order to meet the customers' unique medical needs. Canopy Growth is currently in the process of seeking provisional patents for several areas ranging from insomnia to fibromyalgia pain.
Among its recent developments, the company in the second quarter, launched a brand for the recreational market in Canada called LBS. It boasts a globally recognized family of brands, both in-house and built through partnerships as well with icons in the cannabis space. LBS is the company's latest addition to this line-up. This brand, while positioning itself as the gold standard in the cannabis industry, should help accelerating sales in Canada. Moreover, this should get reflected in the company's second-quarter numbers.

Canopy Growth has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's Earnings ESP of -47.80% makes surprise prediction difficult. Thus, this combination fails to forecast a positive surprise for the stock this reporting cycle.

The e-commerce giant has recently joined forces with Woolpert, a Beavercreek-based engineering, geospatial and architecture firm for the development of its airport project called Amazon CVG Air Cargo Hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
Per the terms of the deal, Woolpert will assist in the planning of landside and airside design. Further, it will provide services related to survey and civil engineering.
The latest move of Amazon is likely to bring efficiency to its project. Further, AECOM, an engineering company has been contracted for the designing of the cargo hub's facility complex.
Strengthening Freight Services
The abovementioned endeavor of Amazon is in sync with its continued focus toward enhancement of its goods shipment services.
Reportedly, Amazon CVG Air Cargo Hub which is at its development stage will include several parking positions, huge airfield pavement, support facilities and various platform levels on its completion.
Further, Amazon Air has announced plans to set up a package-sorting facility and a new air gateway at Wilmington Air Park. The company's plan is inclusive of daily flights. Notably, this project is likely to aid socially as well by creating numerous jobs in the Clinton County.
Additionally, the company has received its 20th B767-300 converted freighter from the Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW . This has strengthened Amazon's domestic air network.
Notably, the expanding freight services of the company will fasten its delivery services in the domestic as well as in the global markets. This bodes well for its dominant position in the global e-commerce market.
Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 44% over a year, outperforming the industry 's rally of 0.4%.
Retail Segment to Benefit
We believe strengthening freight facility and delivery services will aid the company's expanding footprint in the international online retail markets as it is likely to expand its customer reach by reducing shipping times.
Moreover, this will help the company in delivering enhanced shopping experience to its customers. This in turn will aid Amazon in attracting customers to its e-commerce platform, consequently expanding customer base.
All these will drive the company's top-line. Further, it will strengthen the retail segment of Amazon which is its core business

The e-commerce giant has recently joined forces with Woolpert, a Beavercreek-based engineering, geospatial and architecture firm for the development of its airport project called Amazon CVG Air Cargo Hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.
Per the terms of the deal, Woolpert will assist in the planning of landside and airside design. Further, it will provide services related to survey and civil engineering.
The latest move of Amazon is likely to bring efficiency to its project. Further, AECOM, an engineering company has been contracted for the designing of the cargo hub's facility complex.
Strengthening Freight Services
The abovementioned endeavor of Amazon is in sync with its continued focus toward enhancement of its goods shipment services.
Reportedly, Amazon CVG Air Cargo Hub which is at its development stage will include several parking positions, huge airfield pavement, support facilities and various platform levels on its completion.
Further, Amazon Air has announced plans to set up a package-sorting facility and a new air gateway at Wilmington Air Park. The company's plan is inclusive of daily flights. Notably, this project is likely to aid socially as well by creating numerous jobs in the Clinton County.
Additionally, the company has received its 20th B767-300 converted freighter from the Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW . This has strengthened Amazon's domestic air network.
Notably, the expanding freight services of the company will fasten its delivery services in the domestic as well as in the global markets. This bodes well for its dominant position in the global e-commerce market.
Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 44% over a year, outperforming the industry 's rally of 0.4%.
Retail Segment to Benefit
We believe strengthening freight facility and delivery services will aid the company's expanding footprint in the international online retail markets as it is likely to expand its customer reach by reducing shipping times.
Moreover, this will help the company in delivering enhanced shopping experience to its customers. This in turn will aid Amazon in attracting customers to its e-commerce platform, consequently expanding customer base.
All these will drive the company's top-line. Further, it will strengthen the retail segment of Amazon which is its core business

Semiconductor stocks, like the rest of the broader tech market, have been under heavy pressure in late 2018. A slowdown in the semiconductor market as well as the tariff wars between China and the U.S. have also affected sentiment in the sector.
Although many of these chip stocks, including Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), AdvancedMicro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), are much cheaper than they were at the start of September, investors should not expect the choppiness in individual share prices to be over yet.
Furthermore, the daily volatility of all three of these semiconductor stocks is high, giving each a broad trading range. As such, investors should expect to see wide daily price swings in these names during the final weeks of 2018.
INTC, AMD and NVDA shares have each been darlings of Wall Street until recently, but as we approach the end of the year, many analysts and investors are doubtful as to what is next for these stocks. Going into 2019, I believe investors will have to be more selective regarding which chip stocks they choose to invest in, as some are likely to do better than others.
15 Winners and Losers From This Earnings Season
With that said, here's why you should consider these three semiconductor stocks to buy for success in 2019.
Intel (INTC)
Source: Shutterstock
Of the three semiconductor stocks in this article, I am most bullish on INTC stock.
Intel's earnings release on Oct. 25 showed robust top-line and data-center growth. Intel has been improving its competitive situation vis-a-vis other chip companies as the company continues to manufacture high-tech products ahead of the competition.
The technical chart for INTC stock is showing strength with more upside potential than downside risk. Long-term moving averages are giving a ""buy"" signal and share volume has been increasing on the days that the price has gone up - another bullish sign.
During the rest of the year, I expect INTC stock to trade between $44 and $54. Intel's healthy dividend yield of 2.5% and on-going share buyback program are also likely to provide strong support for the Intel stock price in the weeks and months ahead.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: Shutterstock
Over the past years, investors in AMD stock have been delighted with the price performance of their shares. Advanced Micro Devices showed that it could be a direct threat to Intel in client computing and data-centers.
Intel's price misery became Advanced Micro Devices' price gain. However, the positive sentiment and hype surrounding AMD stock has now been replaced with a downtrend trend and negative momentum. In its earnings call on Oct. 24, AMD management stated that lower demand from cryptocurrency mining - once an overheated market - hurt its GPU sales and the tariff wars were impacting its revenues.
The technical chart for AMD stock is pointing to further price weakness in the coming weeks, and both the short-term and the long-term moving averages are giving a ""sell"" signal. As a momentum stock, there is a high probability that the share price may go down to $15 or even lower.
7 Dividend Stocks That Are Worth Your Money
In the second half of 2019, I expect the AMD stock price to settle between $20 - $25. In the case of a swift resolution to the trade wars, the AMD stock price is likely to have about a rapid 10-15% move upward, which mainly makes it an appealing semiconductor stock for investors that are more risk adverse.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: Shutterstock
Nvidia, like INTC, has a robust data-center story. However, gaming - its most significant revenue contributor with a mid-priced product - is experiencing a slowdown and tariffs are also affecting NVDA stock negatively.
The company reports earnings on Thursday, Nov. 15 , after the close of the market. The weak GPU channel sales reported by AMD in late October will probably come up in Nvidia'searnings calland projections too.
Although NVDA stock has a good track record of beating expectations, I am not looking for a big move upward, nor am I expecting positive guidance. Therefore, I would avoid buying NVDA stock before theearnings call
Based on the near-term option prices, I am expecting a drop in the stock of approximately 10% on Friday and next week. Moreover, the technical chart for NVDA stock - like that of AMD - still looks rather weak by most indicators, which points to a potential fall in the price of Nvidia stock to $145.
As such, patient investors who wait to get into NVDA shares later in the year are likely to have good returns in 2019.
The Bottom Line on These Three Semiconductor Stocks
Source: Shutterstock
All three chip stocks, INTC, AMD and NVDA, have strong fundamental growth prospects in the long-run, despite having come off significantly from their recent highs. Therefore, investors may start thinking about which shares they would like to see in their portfolio at these lower prices.
If I had to rank them, I would start the buying with Intel, followed by AMD and finally NVDA stock.
November does not yet seem to be a good time for entry into AMD stock or NVDA, but December may be a different story for these semiconductor stocks as investors may decide to step in from the sidelines.
7 Buy-Rated Tech Stocks at Steep Discounts
Ultimately, investors should always base their decisions on individual risk/return profiles and remember that technology shares are not likely to have double-digit returns in 2019 while valuations and expectations become more rational.
As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Amid manufacturing issues, Chinese-American trade wars, and scandals in the C-suite, the stock has struggled to keep up with the general market. Share prices are trading almost exactly sideways over the last 52 weeks, looking back at a gain of just 2.8% since early January.
The road to this humble milestone was a rocky one, too. Intel's stock price stands 13% above its 52-week lows but 18% below the annual highs. Those are some wild swings for an industry giant and Dow Jones Industrials member with a $220 billion market cap.
What happened to Intel in 2018?
Back in February, Chipzilla admitted to having production issues . That's bad news for a company that counts a constant state of next-generation manufacturing technology as a serious competitive advantage, and it gave smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) a chance to seize the day. That possibility has been haunting Intel all year, even though AMD doesn't seem to have taken advantage of this rare opportunity.
A few months later, CEO Brian Krzanich resigned after five years on the job. He was allegedly violating Intel's code of conduct by having a ""consensual relationship"" with a lower-ranked employee at the company. The company is still searching for a permanent replacement, and longtime CFO Bob Swan is running the show in the interim. Fellow Motley Fool Ashraf Eassa had been hoping Krzanich would step out , but it's never fun to see a high-ranking executive make a quick exit under scandalous circumstances.
As for this summer's heated trade arguments between China and America, entire industries have seen their stock prices suffer as a direct result. Intel followed right along as investors tried to figure out how badly this political conflict might hurt the company. In October, Swan shared the following statement as part of the third-quarter earnings call :
Where is Intel going next?
So here we are with just six weeks left in 2018, and Intel's stock chart is stalled at roughly breakeven for the year. And here's where the year's most turbulent issues stand today:
Intel claims to have a solution for its manufacturing issues ahead of schedule, closing AMD's window of opportunity in early 2019.
As Swan said, those Chinese tariffs may or may not hurt Intel in the end. At the very least, there hasn't been any significant damage done to date.
And the company still needs a permanent CEO.
Resolving the CEO issue appears to be at the top of Intel's list of priorities right now. Other than that, the company is doing well, and its product road map looks attractive over the next couple of years.
At the same time, the stock looks cheap at a P/E of just 10.9 after taking the year off from the strident gains it posted in recent years. If you don't own any Intel shares yet, this could be a great time to get started. And we current shareholders might want to add to our positions while the discounts last.

The S&P 500's 0.75% loss booked on Wednesday could have been worse, though not a lot worse. At one point it was down as much as 1.3%. Still, it was the fourth straight loss for the index, three of which were sizable. The market's true strength is once again being called into question.
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) supplied most of the dead weight, falling 2.8% after Guggenheim lowered its rating on the stock while simultaneously lowering its earnings expectations of the company. PG&E (NYSE: PCG ) was the biggest loser for the session, however, with the utility stock sliding 21.8% in response to the possibility that it may be at least partially responsible for the spread of California's wildfires .
There were some winners. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), for instance, raced 6.1% higher for no reason in particular … other than the fact that it's a name traders love to love. But, with declining stocks outpacing advancers by about two to one, there just weren't enough names like AMD to get the broad market anywhere near positive territory.
As Thursday's trading action kicks off, it's the stock charts of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX ) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) that merit the closest looks. Here's the deal.
Adobe (ADBE)
A week and a half ago Adobe was one of the three stock charts put into focus, as shares were being forced into a retest of a key moving average line by the stock's falling 20-day moving average line.
7 Buy-Rated Tech Stocks at Steep Discounts
The bulls took one last shot at turning things around, but hitting a new but just-as-tough wall, they yielded pretty quickly to the bigger bearish tide. As of Wednesday, ADBE has broken below the first critical support level. One more bad day could break the last remaining floor.
Click to Enlarge • The big support level in question is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. Friday's last trade leaves it as far below the 200-day line as it's been since 2016.
• A minor floor has taken shape around $231, marked with a red dashed line. If that floor snaps too, there's not much left that will keep the stock propped up.
• Should the bears push Adobe over the edge, the next-best landing spot is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line near $208.
TJX Companies (TJX)
Shares of off-price retailer TJX Companies certainly had a good run earlier this year, but as of August the sheer weight of those gains proved problematic. The stock became range-bound, between $52.40 and $56.30.
Just a few days ago it looked like the stock was going to stage a breakout past the upper edge of that boundary. But, in just three trading days, TJX has moved dangerously close to breaking below that range instead. One more misstep could start a selling avalanche.
Click to Enlarge • The clues don't point in favor of the bulls. The selling volume has been on the rise for the past three days, and there's a bullish gap from August that's begging to be filled back in.
• TJX Companies hasn't yet broken below that floor though, nor has it broken below the 100-day moving average line, in gray, that has since stepped up as a potential support level.
• Though the gap is relatively small and only requires a move to $50.90 to fill it in, if that selloff gets started it may not be easily stopped. The next most likely landing point is around $47.
Morgan Stanley (MS)
Finally, Morgan Stanley shares have been in a well-defined downtrend since April. And, though technically oversold and arguably ripe for a reversal, the sheer bearish momentum has made it tough for the stock to even attempt a reversal. Wednesday's action underscores that reality, setting the stage for even lower lows.
Click to Enlarge • The falling trading range is plotted on both stock charts, by white dashed lines. Lending a helping hand is the 50-day moving average line, in purple, which was tested yesterday only to send MS shares sharply lower.
• A close look at the volume trend, as evidenced by the falling accumulation-distribution line and the Chaikin line's value under zero, clarifies that there are still plenty of sellers coming out of the woodwork.
• The downtrend has a pretty clear path to $40, give or take, where a major floor was made in early 2017. That value marks a 32% retracement from the stock's peak, which should be enough to fully clear off the weak hands.

Nvidia stock is tanking after the chip maker's guidance disappointed.
On Thursday after the market close, Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) reported fiscal-third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.84. It also posted $3.18 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared with the $3.24 billion average forecast, according to FactSet.
The chip maker also forecasted a sales range materially below expectations for the January quarter at $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2% versus Wall Street's $3.4 billion consensus.
""Our near-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the crypto-currency boom, which will be corrected. Our market position and growth opportunities are stronger than ever,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was quoted in the earnings release.
Cryptocurrency miners have used graphics cards based on Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) and Nvidia's chips to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. Demand for mining has gone down as the prices of digital currencies have plunged. For example, the price of Ether is down more than 85% from its January high.
Nvidia shares were down 18% in premarket trading on Friday morning.
Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress also said in her quarterly commentary that gaming revenue fell short of the company's internal expectations and the excess inventories were midrange last-generation ""Pascal"" graphic cards.
""We believe this is a near-term issue that will be corrected in one to two quarters, and remain confident in our competitive position and market opportunities,"" she wrote.
In September, Nvidia launched its first gaming graphics cards based on its next-generation ""Turing"" architecture.

In a volatile market, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) stock has remained a bedrock of stability. For the year so far, the shares have gained about 11%, and this mostly is in line with its long-term track record. Note that during the past ten years KO stock has posted an average annual return of 10.54%.
In light of this, is it any wonder that the company is a top holding of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) Warren Buffett? Of course not. Consider that he owns a whopping 400 million shares.
Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, but in the case of Coke it does look like there will continue to be steady growth.
10 Blue-Chip Stocks That Will Lose You Money
Keys to Coke's Success
One key is that the company has been innovating its product line. Hey, just look at Coca-Cola Zero. Part of the success has been the use of sweetners like aspartame and acesulfame K, making the drink more like a traditional coke. Coca-Cola Zero also has much more engaging packaging. As a result, the drink has been posting strong growth (up double digits during the latest quarter).
But there are many other offerings that have been nice drivers and should help provide continued momentum for KO stock. They include:
smartwater : This has been a big winner. So yes, Coke is in the process of scaling this out. By the end of this year, smartwater will be available in 32 countries. There has also been some innovations like smartwater antioxidant and smartwater alkaline.
Sprite and Fanta : These may be old brands but they have been reinvigorated. Consider that Coca-Cola has focused on no-or-low calorie recipes.
Diet Coke : Coca-Cola has seen growth with this brand as the company has added new flavors, such as ginger lime, feisty cherry and zesty blood orange.
Energy Drinks : This market continues to be robust. So Coca-Cola has been getting more aggressive, as the company has created Coca-Cola Energy. Although, partner Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST ) is not happy about this and has instituted an arbitration proceeding .
In the meantime, Coca-Cola has been aggressive with M&A and strategic investments, which has led to an expansion of the brand portfolio. The company has purchased Organic & Raw Trading (the developer of the MOJO kombucha brand) and Tropico (the creator of various fruit-flavored beverages).
Then there were investments in Bodyarmor , which has premium sports performance brands, and Made Group , a maker of juice and protein smoothies.
But of course, the transformative deal was the $5.1 billion acquisition of Costa, which is a UK-based retail coffee chain.
Granted, it's a risky deal. Let's face it, this means KO will take on the mighty Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). But the deal should help diversify KO's product line and also provide a strong platform to gain a footprint in emerging markets, especially China.
Bottom Line on KO Stock
All in all, the strategy for KO is coming together nicely. It also helps that the company still has strong pricing power. This is definitely critical as the costs of ingredients and materials continue to rise.
KO stock also has a decent dividend yield, which is at 3.14%. And more importantly, the company has a long history of increases.
So again, when it comes to KO stock, don't expect too much excitement. The company is likely to be more of a model of stability. Although, with the volatility in the markets, this may be a big attraction for many investors.

The market may have ended last week on a bullish foot, but it sure didn't start this week out in the same mood. The S&P 500 ended Monday's action at 2690.73, down 1.66%.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) did most of the damage, falling 12% thanks to a combination of imploding cryptocurrencies and uncertainty as to the merits of the gains Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) dished out earlier this year following its third-quarter report . AMD stock was down as well for the same reasons though, off to the tune of 7.5%.
There were winners. A beleaguered Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) mustered a 2.2% gain primarily on news that it was forging ahead with autonomous vehicles. Investors were just happy to find a sliver of encouraging news on Wall Street on Monday. There just wasn't enough of it.
The sheer scope of yesterday's tumble, however, makes today's action questionable. The pullback was so steep that once again, the door has been opened to a bounce that could turn into more. To that end, the stock charts of Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU ), Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) and PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM ) are of interest this morning mostly because they're all working their way into conditions that supersede the market's ultra-short-term odds.
Micron Technology (MU)
It's probably being driven more by the broad selloff from the tech sector than by Micron Technology in particular. But, the underlying reason isn't entirely relevant. What matters is what's happening, and what that may mean ahead.
7 Tech Stocks to Buy That Can Lead a Sector Turnaround
And what's happening with MU is, it's trapped in a well-defined downtrend that suggests lower lows lie ahead.
Click to Enlarge • The downtrend in question is plotted with red dashed lines on the daily chart. Micro just kissed the upper edge of that zone, and rolled over and is on track to reach the lower edge again.
• On the weekly chart as well as the daily chart it's clear the break below the rising support line, plotted as a white dashed line, was the tipping point.
• The next most likely landing point for this pullback is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $30.56.
Intuit (INTU)
During Monday's regular-hours session, Intuit shares fell 5.8% before the post-close release of the company's third quarter earnings. Part of that weakness was the exit of a risky trade in front of risky news, while the bigger part of it was simply market related. Either way, INTU was pushed to the brink of a major meltdown.
The good earnings news sparked a sizeable rebound in after-hours trading that appears to have carried through to today, abating the risk at hand. But, the potential for a major breakdown is still there.
Click to Enlarge • The line in the sand is $196.11, where Intuit hit a low on Monday as well as a low last month. Lending a helping hand as a technical floor is the 200-day moving average line at $198.90, which didn't let INTU close below that level.
• Though Intuit shares have backed away from danger for the time being, as overbought as it has become since last year, traders will want to keep an eye on the floor around $196 for a few more days.
• If that floor snaps as support, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line at $173.48 becomes the next most likely landing point.
PulteGroup (PHM)
Just because a stock manages to move higher on a bearish day doesn't inherently make it a name worth buying, but it sure doesn't hurt the bullish argument. And, just because a stock dishes out a gain against a backdrop of discouraging industry news doesn't add to the bullish thesis, but it certainly doesn't' detract from it either.
Both apply to PulteGroup shares as Tuesday's trading gets going. It was up 1% against the bearish tide on Monday, and it made the gain despite the new two-year low reading in homebuilder confidence . We may have already seen the capitulation.
Click to Enlarge • The bears had ample opportunity to push Pulte shares lower. They just couldn't. Instead, PHM stock was able to crawl back above its 20-day and 50-day moving average lines.
• Also note that the buying volume continues to grow on the way up.
• The weekly chart puts it all in perspective. Though demand for new homes truly is fading, investors over-punished PulteGroup for it. Now the pendulum is swinging the other way. Clearing the hurdle at $25.40 will be the key.

The stock markets finally caught a bid ahead of Thanksgiving, hoping to give investors some sort of comfort going into the holidays. Some will turn up for Friday's session while others will stay offline and enjoy a four-day weekend. For those that can't help but sneak a peek at their portfolios, here are our top stock trades to watch for Friday.
Top Stock Trades for Friday No. 1: Foot Locker (FL)
Shares of Foot Locker (NYSE: FL ) are bursting higher on Wednesday, jumping 14% after the company beat on earnings , revenue and comp-store sales expectations. Time to pile in?
While the rally is impressive, particularly after Tuesday's decline, FL is just too volatile for me.
FL stock held its uptrend for this year, but is being pressured by long-term downtrend resistance. Above this mark and the 200-week moving average and investors will have an attractive risk/reward on the long side. Otherwise, they may be able to buy on a pullback to uptrend support.
For me though, this name is simply too volatile right now.
Top Stock Trades for Friday No. 2: Deere (DE)
Is this a bullish sign or a fake-out on a low-volume trading day?
Shares of Deere (NYSE: DE ) are up 3% on Wednesday despite missing on earnings and revenue estimates, and providing disappointing guidance for 2019. The stock was initially lower on the day, but has reversed higher.
There's support in that $130 to $135 area, but the stock continues to put in a series of lower highs. That's unattractive, as is Deere's inability to get above its three major moving averages.
As it stagnates near current levels, my gut tells me Deere is a no-touch below $150. Above that mark and perhaps we can get a rally. But until the indices start playing ball, gains will be hard to come by. Look to see if Deere comes back down to support - and if it holds.
Top Stock Trades for Friday No. 3: GameStop (GME)
With a market cap of just $1.4 billion, GameStop (NYSE: GME ) selling its almost 1,300 AT&T (NYSE: T ) Wireless stores for $700 million is a big deal. It's why the stock is up almost 14% on Wednesday. But is it enough to make GameStop stock a buy?
While the company will likely benefit from a strong holiday season, the long-term business is still not attractive to me. Neither are the charts.
Even after a rally like this, shares still can't get above the 200-day moving average, as highlighted above. Until that's the case, even short-term bulls should avoid this one. Maybe, just maybe, it can rally to $15. But that would setup as a great selling opportunity, at least in my view.
Top Stock Trades for Friday No. 4: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
One stock investors can consider buying on the dip is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ). This name continued to churn higher and higher, until Wednesday's 3% fall.
The drop put JNJ right down into its 50-day moving average. With a solid business, rock solid balance sheet and dividend dependability, many investors feel they can hide out in stocks like J&J.
They now have a solid risk/reward pullback in JNJ. If it closes below the 50-day moving average, investors can bail with minimal losses. If it holds, look for a rebound back to recent highs.
Top Stock Trades for Friday No. 5: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
The charts are not setting up well for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). The stock is struggling to get above the $22 level, as downtrend resistance (blue line) continues to pressure AMD stock lower.
There are a few main levels to watch here, starting with support. Look to see if AMD retests its 200-day moving average. If so, it will be the third touch since late-October and second time in just a few sessions. That's not too bullish, but another test will likely draw in some short-term buyers.
Below the 200-day puts the October lows back in play and breaks the higher lows theme AMD had put together. Below the October lows and it can get ugly for AMD.
On the upside, let's see if AMD can get above downtrend resistance. If so, it puts the $22 level and the 100-day moving average on the table.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

That is because the Nov 30, 2018 $23.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
What is Implied Volatility?
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.
What do the Analysts Think?
Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Advanced Micro Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Advanced Micro Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Electronics - Semiconductors industry that ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 10 cents per share to 9 cents in that period.
Given the way analysts feel about Advanced Micro Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

People are as enamored as ever with the discounts coming their way from traditional retailers like Macy's M , online retailers like Amazon AMZN , eBay EBAY and so on, and those retailers like Walmart WMT that are leveraging their strength (physical presence) to make the most of buy online and pick up at store models.
""The combination of increased job creation, improved wages, tamed inflation and an increase in net worth all provide the capacity and the confidence to spend,"" says the National Retail Federation's (NRF) Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz.
This is borne out by the numbers presented by Adobe ADBE Analytics, which notes an 8.5% increase in average online order values to $146 on Friday, driven by increased spending on big-ticket items like appliances, furniture and bulkier electronics.
And more people are doing more of their shopping on their devices (""click-and-collect"" orders jumped 73% from Thanksgiving to Black Friday), particularly their phones (who would have thought, just a few years back?) considering the limitations of screen real estate. But it turns out that convenience counts more than most things because this was the first year that smartphones generated $2 billion+ in sales with mobile devices accounting for 33.5% of ecommerce sales (29.1% just last year).
And once the real job of selection is out of the way, what could be better than moving around, soaking in the holiday mood and stopping by a coffee shop or eatery while you're at it.
This year's favorites were laptops and streaming devices such as Roku, Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV. Top selling video games were Red Dead Redemption 2 , Let's Go Pikachu and God of War .
Overall, it was a very big day grossing $6.22 billion in online sales, up 23.6% from a year ago and setting a new high, eclipsing the $3.7 billion on Thanksgiving Day, which was also up 28%.
Adobe is expecting Cyber Monday sales online to set a new record of $7.8 billion, up 17.6% percent from last year.
The NRF expects holiday retail sales in November and December - excluding automobiles, gasoline and restaurants - to increase 4.3-4.8% this year and generate $717.45-$720.89 billion. This comes off a very strong years in 2017 when holiday sales grew 5.3% to $687.87 billion, the largest increase since the 5.2% jump in 2010, which came off a big recession.

At times, it is rational to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.
Here we focus on Shopify Inc.SHOP , a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 25%. The company's earnings are expected to register growth of 93.7% and 116.9% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
The company's price performance over the past year looks impressive. Shares of Shopify have gained 28.9%, against the industry 's decline of 26.6%.
We believe the stock has the potential to sustain momentum. The company's strategic acquisitions and diversified expanding merchant base are the primary reasons fueling optimism. Shopify continues to launch a number of merchant-friendly applications to meet the requirements of a dynamic retail environment, in turn bolstering its merchant base.
Let's discuss them in detail.
Growth Drivers
Shopify delivered third-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 4 cents per share comparing favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 4 cents.
Total revenues surged 58% from the year-ago quarter to $270.1 million, comfortably outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $257 million. The figure also fared better than the guided range of $253-$257 million.
Robust performance of Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital also aided growth. Markedly, revenues of both Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital have ""doubled"" year over year.
Management remains positive about the company's expanding partner ecosystem that aids it to identify and reach merchants who are otherwise inaccessible. The total number of apps registered in the App store amount to more than 2,200. More than 16,500 partners referred merchants to Shopify in the past 12 months.
The company unveiled various enhancements and new technologies aimed at improving selling experience of merchants.
Shopify has introduced Shopify AR in a bid to enrich user engagement. For instance, mobile shoppers will be able to view 3D models for assessing whether the purchase of cycles, furniture, among others, will fit in the physical space properly.
Recently, it also revamped its Shopify App Store, in order to provide an enhanced experience on mobile and desktop.
Further, Shopify rolled out a new feature, named Locations, enabling customers to track orders seamlessly. In the last reported quarter, the company introduced Shopify Payments in Germany.
In an effort to make the platform more merchant friendly, Shopify is working on extending language capabilities beyond English. The focus on local languages is aiding in bolstering international presence. We believe this inclusive move will boost engagement and in turn increase adoption going forward.
Moreover, the company will reap benefits from investments in latest technological developments such as virtual reality (""VR"") and augmented reality (""AR""), going forward.
Shopify has been developing various apps, including various AR based applications to streamline customer experience.
Moreover, sales channels like Google Pay, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Pinterest, eBay EBAY and Amazon AMZN continue to attract new merchants. The availability of Apple Pay, Google Pay and the addition of Canada Post as sales channels are expected to be other tailwinds.
These innovative initiatives to enhance visibility across physical outlets and explore new markets are anticipated to significantly expand merchant base, going ahead.
Bottom Line
The aforementioned factors positively impacted Shopify's performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering average positive surprise of 195%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, consequently giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Currently, Shopify has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Infineon Technologies AG IFNNY sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is worth considering in the broader technology sector. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Infineon is 8.62%.
The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All
Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

VMW jumped nearly 5% during regular trading Wednesday. So, should investors expect the business-focused cloud computing firm to post strong Q3 financial results Thursday, or did VMW stock get a boost from its peer Salesforce's CRM strong quarterly performance?
Cloud-based customer relationship management power Salesforce saw its stock price soar over 10% Wednesday after it reported its Q3 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. The company's earnings blew away our Zacks Consensus Estimate and its sales climbed 26% from the year-ago quarter.
Meanwhile, VMware has seen its stock price surge over 17% in the last month as the broader market moved mostly sideways. Shares of VMware closed regular trading Wednesday at $159.76 per share, which marked a roughly 3% decline from its 52-week high $165.00 per share.
Jumping back a bit further, we can see that shares of VMW have outpaced its industry over the past two years. Plus, VMware stock has topped its peer group over this stretch, which includes the likes of Adobe ADBE and Oracle ORCL .
VMware's Q3 revenues are projected to climb 9.7% to reach $2.17 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Palo Alto-based tech company's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to jump 11.9% to $1.50 per share. Yet, we still need to know how likely it is that VMware can top our quarterly earnings estimates.
Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive Earnings ESP figure to help us. The Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter. The Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.
This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.
VMware is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This, unfortunately, means that our model is inconclusive. Yet, investors should note that the company has topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods.
VMware is set to release its third quarter financial results after the market closes on Thursday.

Fear came to Wall Street this fall. From tariffs and trade wars to rising interest rates and a slowing economy, jittery investors have had a spate of negative news to worry about. Tech stocks bore the brunt of the damage with high growth, momentum names falling into bear markets across the board.
But if yesterday's rousing rebound is any indication, these FANG stocks aren't going down without a fight. The culprit for Wednesday's snap-back was two-fold.
First, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a dovish tone during yesterday's speech suggesting the current level of interest rates is nearing neutral. The commentary caused the Street to downshift the number of rate hikes expected next year. And, well, everybody jumped back into the equity pool sending stocks flying.
Second, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) delivered blowout earnings, which quelled fears that economic weakness is hampering corporate profits in tech stocks.
If yesterday's positive undertones persist, now may be a good time to shop for the best tech stocks to buy.
10 Stocks to Buy for a Rate Hike Slowdown
Here are three for your consideration.
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: ThinkorSwim
Tech stocks like Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) came roaring back yesterday. What I find particularly impressive is how Wednesday's surge negated the massive support break from earlier in the month. The breakout has officially become a fakeout.
With short-sellers now thoroughly scorched, ADBE stock could continue powering higher. In the short run, some backing and filling is likely, however. Adobe is up some 21% in the past six trading sessions and testing its falling 50-day moving average.
Unless it falls back below $231, buyers deserve the benefit of the doubt.
ADBE is slated to report earnings on Dec. 13.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Source: ThinkorSwim
Once-loved semiconductor stocks quickly became loathed this fall. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) shares were demolished to the tune of 53% before finally finding a bottom.
The price action over the past six weeks has been constructive. Both tests of the 200-day moving average were defended vigorously by bulls. And we now have a healthy base to launch from if AMD wants to reclaim its former glory. Resistance near $22 is the level to watch. A break above that will turn the daily trend higher.
7 Consumer Stocks to Buy and Hold Through the New Year
The cheap price tag and high implied volatility make AMD stock a prime naked put candidate. If you're willing to bet it remains firm, then sell the Jan $17 put for 58 cents.
Microsoft (MSFT)
Source: ThinkorSwim
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has exhibited relative strength throughout the turmoil, and it has held up much better than the FANG gang. Yesterday's rally in MSFT stock places an exclamation point on its recent muscle-flexing by sending the stock back above its 50-day moving average amid heavy volume.
At $111, MSFT remains a mere pebble toss from record highs. Like Adobe, Microsoft has risen considerably over the last six trading sessions (12%) so a pause or pullback could be in order before it revisits its prior peak of $116.18.
Nonetheless, if you're seeking one of the best stocks to buy, MSFT deserves your attention.
Consider buying the Jan $110/$115 bull call spread for around $2.10.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

For the Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF (Symbol: PKW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $68.02 per unit.
With PKW trading at a recent price near $59.02 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.24% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PKW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Lithia Motors Inc (Symbol: LAD), eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), and FedNat Holding Co (Symbol: FNHC). Although LAD has traded at a recent price of $82.86/share, the average analyst target is 33.96% higher at $111.00/share. Similarly, EBAY has 29.11% upside from the recent share price of $29.85 if the average analyst target price of $38.54/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting FNHC to reach a target price of $28.00/share, which is 27.97% above the recent price of $21.88. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LAD, EBAY, and FNHC:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

This headwind is overshadowing basically all other conversations, including strong reads on earnings and revenue in many sectors.
Wall Street got what it wanted from last weekend's G20 summit, as trade representatives from the U.S. and China agreed to halt new tariffs for 90 days in order to work on a longer-term agreement. But that optimism was quickly erased thanks to discouraging trade-related news, including a series of tweets from President Trump and the arrest of U.S.-backed arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.
The trade war is now, without a doubt, the number one headwind affecting stocks, especially considering last week's surprise dovish turn from the Fed. Sure, folks are worried about a recession on the horizon, but investors are really worried about the trade war sparking a recession much sooner than expected, and that has kept stocks in a bearish range recently.
This makes it difficult for companies reporting earnings during this stretch. Investors need to see powerful beat-and-raised quarters during this non-busy period for reports, and that is no easy task.
With that said, investors should remember to use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.
We have made this task even easier today by selecting a few of next week's top reports to preview right now. Let's take a closer look at a few of the earnings announcements due during the week of December 10.
1. American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO)
Specialty retailer American Eagle is slated to announce its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on December 11. AEO had a great run to start the year, but the stock has now lost more than 30% since reaching five-year highs in August. American Eagle will hope to reignite its earlier momentum with an impressive report.
Analysts expect the retailer to report earnings of $0.47 per share, according to our Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would represent year-over-year growth of 27%. American Eagle has seen positive and negative revisions to estimates within the last 30 days, but the overall consensus has not budged. Revenue is projected to be up nearly 8% to $1.04 billion.
2. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)
Big-box retail giant Costco is expected to release its most recent quarterly report after the closing bell on December 13. Costco shares have added about 23% so far this year. The company posts monthly sales results and just announced that Q1 same-store sales growth reached 8.8%, crushing expectations. That should serve as an indicator that next week's full report will be largely positive.
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are pegged at $1.62 per share for earnings and $34.5 billion for revenue. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 19% and 9%, respectively. COST is trading at roughly 30x earnings ahead of the report.
3. Adobe Inc. (ADBE)
Software innovator Adobe will release its earnings report after U.S. markets close on December 13. A darling momentum stock for the past few years, Adobe has pulled back from its highs as investors have ditched high-flying tech picks in recent months. That said, ADBE is still up over 40% in 2018 and could extend those gains with another great report.
Adobe's earnings per share are expected to improve 49% to reach $1.88 for the quarter, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue is estimated to grow nearly 21% to total $2.42 billion. These results would bring full-year earnings and revenue growth to roughly 58% and 23%, respectively.
Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies
It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.

On its face, the valuation of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) seems absurd. MU stock trades at 3.5 times analysts' consensus fiscal 2019 EPS estimates. That valuation alone seems to suggest huge upside for Micron stock.
But MU is a $43 billion stock and one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. The seemingly ridiculous multiple isn't a case of the market not paying attention. As I detailed back in September, there's a legitimate bear case for Micron stock . The company's earnings will probably decline and could sink sharply. This is one of the most cyclical companies in the world and right now, the cycle looks set to turn against MU.
At the same time, however, I argued a month later that MU stock was set to bottom , as it had become simply too cheap even if the bears were right. Micron stock did rally, but it has since returned to those levels and is now testing its lowest point in over a year.
7 Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market
Now near its lows again, MU stock still looks too cheap. Indeed, some of the risks that were previously embedded in the stock have come to pass, but that only seems to prove the point that $35 is too little to pay for Micron stock.
Micron Stock Models Come Down
When MU stock was at similar levels six weeks ago, my case for Micron stock was based on the idea that much of the downside already seemed priced into MU. The company's earnings were expected to decline, as analysts on average forecast that its earnings per share, excluding some items, would drop 12% in fiscal 2019 (which ends in ending August) and fall another 7%+ the following year. Yet the same analysts who modeled those declines still saw value in Micron stock; their average price target for MU stock stood at $67.
Based on that data, one obvious risk was that analysts were going to have to catch up with the company's performance. Concerns about DRAM pricing, in particular, likely hadn't been baked into analysts' estimates for MU. As estimates were cut, analysts' targets for MU stock would likely head down as well.
And indeed, some of that pressure from the Street has come to bear. Analysts' average fiscal 2019 EPS estimates have come down to $10, against $10.61. Consensus FY20 projections dropped to below $9 from close to $10. And the average price target for MU stock now is $61, not $67.
But MU stock is at $35, meaning that. Micron stock still trades at less than four times the consensus FY20 EPS estimate. And Micron stock is trading under eight times the lowest of 25 estimates for FY20.
It's too optimistic to argue that the absolute worst-case scenario is priced in. Memory prices could collapse (though I think that's unlikely), causing Micron's earnings to tumble. But an awful lot of downside is incorporated into MU stock price.
Will Earnings Hurt or Help Micron Stock?
That said, Micron stock does have a potential hurdle ahead, as it's due to report its fiscal Q1 earnings next week. MU's Q4 earnings handily beat expectations, but MU stock sank anyway. MU then got caught up in the broad market weakness that hit other chip stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). MU stock subsequently reached a 52-week low.
The obvious risk to MU's Q1 results is weak guidance. The market's reaction to the Q4 results seems to suggest that investors have their eyes firmly on the company's outlook and are not going to bid MU stock up based on the company's backward-looking results. The recent rallies of NVDA and AMD have fizzled. So have those of equipment manufacturers Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX ) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT ), which are exposed to similar cyclical forces as Micron.
Though I remain bullish on Micron stock, I'm not sure that the company's Q1 report is likely to be a catalyst. Simply put, Micron's earnings aren't going to convince investors that the cycle isn't turning negative or that Micron isn't cyclical at all.
Of course, MU stock is still cyclical, and memory prices and earnings will probably come down. But memory demand should strengthen over the long-term, and (hopefully) the industry has learned its lessons from the oversupply that crashed memory prices in 2015-2016.
Meanwhile, MU stock is priced as if the world - or perhaps just MU's business - is coming to an end. It's not. And investors will figure that out at some point, perhaps as soon as next week.

For the iShares Russell Top 200 ETF (Symbol: IWL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $72.95 per unit.
With IWL trading at a recent price near $61.46 per unit, that means that analysts see 18.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IWL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Adobe Inc (Symbol: ADBE), Air Products & Chemicals Inc (Symbol: APD), and Deere & Co. (Symbol: DE). Although ADBE has traded at a recent price of $238.00/share, the average analyst target is 22.18% higher at $290.79/share. Similarly, APD has 20.81% upside from the recent share price of $157.16 if the average analyst target price of $189.87/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DE to reach a target price of $175.92/share, which is 19.46% above the recent price of $147.26. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ADBE, APD, and DE:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

EBAY launched its much-awaited Green Monday deals to attract holiday buyers with huge discounts on various products.
It offers special deals including deep discounts on products like Apple MacBook and MacBook Airs, Google Home Hub, David Yurman and Bose Soundtouch 10 Wireless Speaker, among others.
The move is expected to boost revenues as Green Monday is considered one of the biggest shopping days of the year for eBay. Moreover, the company assures to deliver goods in less than three days, with most of the goods being delivered free of cost.
Coming to price performance, eBay's shares have lost 23.2% on a year-to-date basis against the industry 's rally of 1.6%.
Green Monday's Contribution to eBay Sales
E-commerce has been driving holiday sales over the last few years, with an increasing number of consumers preferring to shop online.
With deep discounts and early delivery, Green Monday is a boon in disguise for both the company and holiday shoppers who are waiting for great last-minute deals to complete their shopping lists.
Starting 2007, the second Monday in December is regarded as Green Monday with the company recording one of its biggest sales days. Per Comscore, Green Monday deals led to total sales of $859 million in 2008, which increased significantly to $1.6 billion in 2016, reflecting its growing popularity.
In 2017, the company celebrated its 10th anniversary of Green Monday by launching deals every hour. Notably, Green Monday was as third-highest sales day for the company in the same year.

eBay Expanding Presence to Stay in Competition
eBay is a well-established player in the e-commerce space that has been expanding its services offerings to meet the needs of shoppers.
eBay recently joined forces with leading service providers, namely Handy, Porch and InstallerNet, to offer installation services to its shoppers.
The company's strong focus on strategic partnerships should continue to benefit its market position and lift holiday sales. In addition, this is likely to provide the company an edge over Amazon AMZN and Alibaba BABA in the e-commerce space.
The company also expanded its eBay Authenticate platform into the luxury jewelry category.The latest move is expected to strengthen its client base in the holiday season.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Currently, eBay carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
A better-ranked stock in the broader retail-wholesale sector is Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY , which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.
It's not the one you think.

Plus, the chipmaking powerhouse's Q4 and full-year projections look strong. So, let's see why Intel stock looks like a strong buy as we head into 2019.
Overview
At this point, the delay of Intel's next-generation chips has grabbed a ton of attention, while also helping the likes of Advanced Micro Devices AMD and other Intel competitors. With that said, interim CEO Robert Swan did note on the company's third-quarterearnings callthat it is ""on track for 10-nanometer-based systems on shelves during the holiday 2019 selling season.""
Wall Street will of course closely monitor Intel's progress on its 10nm products. Still, even without its latest chip offerings, the company's Q3 revenues surged 19% to reach $19.16 billion. This beat our expectation and marked an all-time company record. Plus, Intel's IoT and Mobileye autonomous vehicle divisions both posted record revenues.
Price Movement
As we touched on at the top, shares of INTC have jumped 5.5% over the last three months, while the S&P 500 slipped nearly 9%. Despite this recent climb, shares of Intel closed regular trading Tuesday at $47.38 per share. This marked an 18% downturn from its 52-week high of $57.60 per share and sets up what could prove to be a solid buying opportunity for those high on Intel.
On top of that, investors will notice that INTC stock has outpaced its direct peer group's average-which includes Nvidia NVDA and Texas Instruments TXN -over the past few years.
Outlook & Earnings Trends
Moving on, Intel's fourth-quarter revenues are projected to jump 11.5% to reach $19.01 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Plus, the chipmaker's full-year revenues are expected to climb 13.5% to reach $71.2 billion.
Meanwhile, Intel's adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to surge roughly 13% to reach $1.22 per share. Better yet, INTC's adjusted full-year earnings are expected to soar 31%. Maybe more importantly, Intel's earnings outlook has turned far more positive recently as the charts below show us.
Bottom Line
Intel is currently trading at 10.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which represents a discount compared its industry's 13.1X average and the S&P's 15.8X. Better yet, INTC stock has traded as high as 14.8X over the last year alone and rests below its five-year median of 13.3X and right above its five-year low of 10X. Therefore, Intel's valuation picture looks pretty attractive at its current level.
Intel is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment based, in large part, on its recent earnings estimate revision trends. The company is also a dividend payer that rests well below its 52-week high.
Therefore, investors might want to consider Intel stock heading into 2019 with the company currently projected to report its Q4 earnings results on January 24.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Well, there you have it. The Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates yet again, but curbed its rate-hiking outlook for 2019 from 3 hikes to 2. Still, markets aren't loving it, with major U.S. indices reversing from their gains to now trading in the red. What now? Let's look at a few must-see stock charts.
Must-See Stock Charts for Tomorrow #1: FedEx
Let's start with a look at several earnings stories, leading off with FedEx (NYSE: FDX ). The stock has been under pressure but its 11% post-earnings decline is only making matters worse. Many considered this report a real doozy .
Last week, FDX knifed through its 200-week moving average and the losses are accelerating this week.
15 Stocks Facing Big Political Risk in 2019
The sell-sign came near $200, when FDX broke below downtrend support. Now nearing $165, some may be wondering if FDX is oversold. After all, it does trade at less than 10 times this year's earnings.
It may be oversold, but why is $165 better than $180 support or $200 support? Until I see FDX start to firm up, it's in no man's land to me.
Must-See Stock Charts for Tomorrow #2: General Mills
General Mills (NYSE: GIS ) remains in a disappointing state, beating on earnings but missing on revenue expectations. After initially rallying to $40, it was promptly rejected by the 21-day moving average.
It now puts the recent lows near $37 back on the table. However, its rejection from $40 was more significant than just hitting the 21-day moving average. Not shown on the chart is the five-year weekly look, which shows that this level has been quite significant over the past few years. Rallying to it and failing shows a significant sentiment shift. I would expect $40 to be resistance going forward.
Must-See Stock Charts for Tomorrow #3: Micron
While we did give an earnings preview for Micron (NASDAQ: MU ), we can't ignore it after today's move. Guidance came up way short and MU broke down as a result. Support gave way and MU tumbled to $31.28 before rebounding.
However, on its rebound it approached prior support near $34 before failing. Like GIS, that's a bad sign for bulls and they will need to see MU reclaim that level before getting significantly bullish in the future.
For now, look to see if MU can get over downtrend resistance and the 21-day moving average. If not, MU will keep getting squeezed lower.
Must-See Stock Charts for Tomorrow #4: Advanced Micro Devices
Like many other stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has had trouble gaining traction to the upside. However, it's still riding the backside of downtrend resistance.
Now just under $19, the stock is coming into uptrend support (black line) and the 200-day moving average. Longs who are looking for a low-risk setup have one. The one caveat here is that break below support could result in an aggressive selloff. So longs dipping their toe in need to be careful.
On a rebound, look for a test of the 21-day moving average near $20.
Must-See Stock Charts for Tomorrow #5: Nvidia
We can't talk AMD without talking about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) right?
10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains
The 21-day moving average has been resistance for Nvidia for two months now as the stock remains trapped in a downtrend. Basically, we need to see NVDA get out of this channel and get above its 21-day. Until it does, Nvidia can keep going lower. As it stands, the 52-week lows are on the table. Will it eventually weigh on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock?

This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.54%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.49%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 2.17%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the software maker had gained 2.94% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.64% and the S&P 500's loss of 6.77% in that time.
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from ADBE as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be March 21, 2019. In that report, analysts expect ADBE to post earnings of $1.63 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 5.16%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $2.54 billion, up 22.3% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.76 per share and revenue of $11.15 billion. These totals would mark changes of +14.79% and +23.43%, respectively, from last year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for ADBE. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 5.9% lower. ADBE currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Investors should also note ADBE's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.14. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 28.16, so we one might conclude that ADBE is trading at a premium comparatively.
We can also see that ADBE currently has a PEG ratio of 1.78. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.05 as of yesterday's close.
The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 57, which puts it in the top 22% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

It is a direct selling (think MLM) and ecommerce business marketing Noni-fruit juice drinks in more than 60 countries around the world with more than 70% of its $240 million in annual revenue generated in five countries: Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia.
Most important, Morinda generated an adjusted EBITDA profit of $25 million in the trailing 12 months; in New Age Beverages' most recent quarterly report ended September 30, it had an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.5 millio n.
7 Reasons Not to Be Too Worried About the Fed Yet
The combination creates a profitable business that can move forward with plans for CBD-infused beverages and its other healthy beverage alternatives in the New Age portfolio.
Is NBEV Stock a ""Monster?""
If you know the history of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST ), you're aware the $30 billion energy drink behemoth was once at a crossroads.
Should it continue to explore energy drinks - before launching Monster in 2002 , Hansen's Natural's, Monster's corporate moniker at the time had tried and failed with two previous energy drink creations - or go with the decently profitable fruit juices it had produced since the 1930s?
Rodney Sacks, Monster Beverages current CEO, bought Hansen's in 1992 for $14.5 million. If not for Sacks' determination to push into the energy drink space, one of the most successful non-alcoholic drink categories of all time, energy drinks might not be nearly as popular as they are today.
In 2003, the first full year of Monster beverage sales, it sold $50 million in energy drinks, which accounted for 36% of Hansen's annual revenues .
Zero to 36% of sales in 21 months. That's got to be a record.
NBEV Stock and the Monster Model
Like Hansen's, New Age has an extensive portfolio of beverage brands, none of them taking off, with total revenues of $38.2 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2018, 6.6% lower than a year earlier.
The company, needing to get bigger in a hurry, and lacking an explosive-growth product like Monster to wow retailers, went the merger route instead, paying $75 million in cash and issuing $10 million in restricted stock to buy Morinda.
It's a smart play to keep the stock rolling higher.
However, the company has way too many brands to succeed long term. It's got to find one or two that can scale on a global basis and stick with those; selling the rest.
To me, its CBD drinks have the most potential. Indeed, the positive reaction by investors to the Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY ) partnership with Anheuser Busch InBev (NYSE: BUD ) would suggest this to be the case.
Launched in October at the North American Convenience Store Show in Las Vegas by the company's Health Sciences division, the demand for these products is likely to be significant.
The big question mark is whether it can execute a successful rollout of the products. Morinda's experience will help.
""We intend to provide a full portfolio of offerings in this emerging growth segment, and expect the range of choices for retailers, distributors and consumers best position New Age to be the leader and authority in the sector,"" said New Age senior vice president of sales, Michael Cunningham.
The Bottom Line on NBEV Stock
I see a ton of similarities between New Age and Monster.
That said, a lot has to go right for New Age to move from Monster-wannabe to the real deal. It's also important to remember that the drinks won't have THC in them so the novelty or desire to try won't be nearly as great.
New Age will have to spend a significant amount on marketing and distribution which suggest profitability might be sacrificed in the short-term to ensure the successful rollout.
As small-cap stocks go, I like it, but don't use your retirement funds at this point in the game if you do buy.
As of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The company's revenue rose 23% year over year to $2.46 billion, beating estimates by $30 million.
Adobe's non- GAAP earnings per share (EPS), which include its acquisition of Marketo, rose 45% to $1.83 per, missing its own forecast by $0.04. But excluding the acquisition of Marketo, that figure would have increased 51% to $1.90 per share to beat expectations by $0.03. On a GAAP basis, Adobe's earnings rose 37% to $1.37 per share.
Adobe's report looked solid, but some confusion regarding the Marketo acquisition and the broader sell-off across the market dragged down the stock. Should investors buy the dip in Adobe, which remains up 20% for the year?
The key numbers
Adobe makes its money from two core businesses -- the Digital Media division, which houses its Creative Cloud services, and the Digital Experience unit, which provides cloud-based marketing and analytics tools to enterprise customers.
Adobe's acquisition of the e-commerce services provider Magento and the business-to-business engagement firm Marketo boosted its Digital Experience revenue this year. During the third quarter, Adobe's Digital Experience revenue grew 25% year over year to $690 million, or 22% excluding Marketo. Adobe's Digital Media revenue, which wasn't boosted by Marketo, rose 23% to $1.71 billion.
For the full year (including Magento and Marketo), Adobe's Digital Experience revenue rose 20% and its Digital Media revenue grew 26% against 2017. In fiscal 2019, Adobe expects its Digital Experience and Digital Media revenues to rise 20% and 34%, respectively, and for its full-year revenue to grow 23% to $11.15 billion. It projects non-GAAP EPS growth of 15% to $7.75.
Plenty of tailwinds
Adobe attributed the strong growth of its Digital Media unit to robust demand for its core Creative Cloud products (including Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, and Acrobat), which dominate the markets of graphic design, video editing, and document production. Adobe pivoted those products from a license-based model to cloud-based subscriptions in recent years, thus locking in customers and guaranteeing them timely updates.
Adobe's Digital Experience revenue grew as its expanding ecosystem of enterprise services attracted big new customers -- including Unilever , Home Depot , and Geico -- during the quarter. Adding Marketo to that ecosystem expands its arsenal of enterprise tools, while the addition of Magento adds additional e-commerce and marketing services. Both acquisitions could help Adobe steal customers away from Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) , which is trying to expand its e-commerce services ecosystem with more marketing, payments, and analytics tools.
Simply put, Adobe is leveraging its market-leading position in Digital Media to aggressively expand its cloud services into the enterprise and e-commerce markets. However, that expansion slightly weighed down its gross and operating margins during the quarter:
Data source: Adobe quarterly reports.
On the bright side, Adobe expects its operating margin to improve sequentially in 2019 (especially in the second half) as it integrates the new businesses. Yet Adobe still retains much higher gross and operating margins than smaller rivals like Shopify, or enterprise cloud service competitors like Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) .
CRM Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts .
Adobe also continues to support its EPS growth with share repurchases. The company purchased roughly $2 billion worth of shares during the fiscal year, a strong vote of confidence for a stock that outperformed the broader markets and many of its industry peers in 2018.
Is it time to buy Adobe?
Adobe's core businesses look solid, its ecosystem is expanding, and its stock isn't too expensive at 30 times forward earnings. Therefore, Adobe is still a great long-term cloud play as it remains more profitable than many of its peers. But investors should nibble on the stock instead of taking on a full position, since the ongoing market correction has been brutal to growth stocks with higher valuations.

After becoming the most valuable U.S. company ever, and briefly topping a $1 trillion market cap , things turned south. A growing trade war with China, a stock market in correction , and fears about slowing iPhone growth have taken the wind out of this highflier, which has lost nearly a third of its value.
A recent decision by Apple -- that it would no longer report unit sales figures for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices -- has many investors convinced that we've reached peak iPhone sales, dimming the company's prospects going forward.
There is, however, an interesting -- if somewhat imperfect -- parallel that can be drawn to a change in strategy several years ago by creative software specialist Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) , that holds an important lesson for Apple investors.
A lesson from the past
Back in 2012, Adobe made the somewhat radical decision -- at the time -- to offer a $50-per-month subscription to its suite of creative tools, alongside the more traditional sales of cellophane-covered boxes with a compact disk and a perpetual license for its software. Some customers were enthusiastic about the new approach and just one year later, Adobe made the controversial decision to discontinue its traditional software sales, moving solely to the cloud-based subscription model.
There was an immediate outcry from many core users, and more than 50,000 signed a Change.org petition, urging Adobe to reconsider the move. Shareholders took flight as revenue fell by nearly 8% year over year in 2013, and grew just 2% the following year.
In hindsight, of course, the move was brilliant. Adobe has achieved year-over-year growth of 20% or greater for 14 consecutive quarters, going all the way back to Q3 2015. That success is built almost entirely on recurring revenue, which now accounts for more than 90% of Adobe's total sales.
What's this got to do with Apple?
Apple has been trying to change the narrative for several years now. By early 2017, services had become a much more important part of its business. CEO Tim Cook hinted at the potential and made a somewhat ambitious pronouncement:
At the time of the announcement, services had generated $25.5 billion over the trailing four quarters and represented just 9% of Apple's annual revenue. Fast-forward to the fourth quarter of 2018, that has jumped to $37.2 billion and 16% of sales. Growth in the segment has been impressive, recently up 24% compared to the prior year -- while iPhone unit sales were flat.
More subscription revenue in Apple's future?
This correlation to recurring subscription revenue like Adobe may be closer than it appears at first glance. Apple has been increasingly hawking subscriptions to services like iCloud, Apple Music, and third-party services, and could potentially include an as-yet-unannounced video streaming service that could debut as early as next year .
Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski has suggested that Apple ""launch a subscription bundle as a way to reinforce iPhone loyalty and leverage it into content."" She calculates that by bundling numerous a la carte services like Apple Music and Apple TV into a streaming subscription that includes an iPhone, the company could generate an additional $19 billion in revenue by 2021.
Jankowski isn't the first to propose a bundle. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty calculated that an Apple media offering that included the company's video content, Apple Music, and its Texture news and magazine service could grow by 21% annually and generate $37 billion by 2025.
The wave of the future
While the analyst's ideas are merely guesswork, it's clear that Apple is pursuing recurring revenue in the form of subscriptions, much like Adobe did several years ago. Apple hasn't revealed the full extent of its plans, and investors don't yet know how it will play out, but the move could eventually be more lucrative -- over the long term -- than the iPhone itself.

After becoming the most valuable U.S. company ever, and briefly topping a $1 trillion market cap , things turned south. A growing trade war with China, a stock market in correction , and fears about slowing iPhone growth have taken the wind out of this highflier, which has lost nearly a third of its value.
A recent decision by Apple -- that it would no longer report unit sales figures for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices -- has many investors convinced that we've reached peak iPhone sales, dimming the company's prospects going forward.
There is, however, an interesting -- if somewhat imperfect -- parallel that can be drawn to a change in strategy several years ago by creative software specialist Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) , that holds an important lesson for Apple investors.
A lesson from the past
Back in 2012, Adobe made the somewhat radical decision -- at the time -- to offer a $50-per-month subscription to its suite of creative tools, alongside the more traditional sales of cellophane-covered boxes with a compact disk and a perpetual license for its software. Some customers were enthusiastic about the new approach and just one year later, Adobe made the controversial decision to discontinue its traditional software sales, moving solely to the cloud-based subscription model.
There was an immediate outcry from many core users, and more than 50,000 signed a Change.org petition, urging Adobe to reconsider the move. Shareholders took flight as revenue fell by nearly 8% year over year in 2013, and grew just 2% the following year.
In hindsight, of course, the move was brilliant. Adobe has achieved year-over-year growth of 20% or greater for 14 consecutive quarters, going all the way back to Q3 2015. That success is built almost entirely on recurring revenue, which now accounts for more than 90% of Adobe's total sales.
What's this got to do with Apple?
Apple has been trying to change the narrative for several years now. By early 2017, services had become a much more important part of its business. CEO Tim Cook hinted at the potential and made a somewhat ambitious pronouncement:
At the time of the announcement, services had generated $25.5 billion over the trailing four quarters and represented just 9% of Apple's annual revenue. Fast-forward to the fourth quarter of 2018, that has jumped to $37.2 billion and 16% of sales. Growth in the segment has been impressive, recently up 24% compared to the prior year -- while iPhone unit sales were flat.
More subscription revenue in Apple's future?
This correlation to recurring subscription revenue like Adobe may be closer than it appears at first glance. Apple has been increasingly hawking subscriptions to services like iCloud, Apple Music, and third-party services, and could potentially include an as-yet-unannounced video streaming service that could debut as early as next year .
Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski has suggested that Apple ""launch a subscription bundle as a way to reinforce iPhone loyalty and leverage it into content."" She calculates that by bundling numerous a la carte services like Apple Music and Apple TV into a streaming subscription that includes an iPhone, the company could generate an additional $19 billion in revenue by 2021.
Jankowski isn't the first to propose a bundle. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty calculated that an Apple media offering that included the company's video content, Apple Music, and its Texture news and magazine service could grow by 21% annually and generate $37 billion by 2025.
The wave of the future
While the analyst's ideas are merely guesswork, it's clear that Apple is pursuing recurring revenue in the form of subscriptions, much like Adobe did several years ago. Apple hasn't revealed the full extent of its plans, and investors don't yet know how it will play out, but the move could eventually be more lucrative -- over the long term -- than the iPhone itself.

PayPal (PYPL) Looks Like a Buy Going into Next Year
Shares of PayPal are still up roughly 10% over the past year despite a ton of turbulence. So, let's see why the financial tech firm's stock looks like a buy heading into 2019 in an industry that is only set to grow.
Recent News
PayPal, which spun off from eBay in 2015, has expanded its reach through a series of acquisitions. This includes the firm's $400 million purchase of Hyperwallet to help expand its global payout capabilities and its $120 million acquisition of fraud prevention firm Simility. PayPal's $2.2 billion purchase-its largest ever-of small business commerce firm iZettle has come under fire from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority after the deal closed in late September.
PayPal has, however, assured the U.K. watchdog that the merger won't hurt consumers. ""We absolutely believe that we will demonstrate that we are bringing more choice (and that) we are pro-competition. We are really looking to expand the market in ways that are great for small business and great for consumers alike,"" PayPal COO Bill Ready told CNBC earlier this month.
Investors will have to wait to see how this situation plays out. But PayPal's purchase of the Stockholm-based firm that has been called the "" Square of Europe "" and operates heavily in Europe, Mexico, and Brazil, was made to help it compete against rivals such as Square and fight off encroachment from the likes of Amazon.
Overview
With all that said, PayPal closed the third quarter with 254 million active accounts, up 15% from the year-ago period. The company's total payment volume also surged 24% to $143 billion. Mobile payment volume accounted for 40% of the firm's overall TPV. Investors should note that the company's widely popular peer-to-peer payment app, Venmo, saw its TPV soar 78% to reach $17 billion.

Today's stock market
Data source: Yahoo! Finance.
Retail stocks fared worse than most after yesterday's impressive rally , leaving the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEMKT: XRT) down 0.3%. Tech stocks jumped, and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK) rose 0.7%.
As for individual stocks, tensions surrounding a key contract renewal left Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) trading lower for much of the day, and a word of caution from Wall Street sent AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) down.
Disney plays hardball
Disney shares initially declined 2.6% after Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) sent an email to its 4.5 million Fios TV customers warning they may lose access to several of Disney's most popular channels. However, like many stocks, the entertainment giant finished the session in the green thanks to the late-day rally, ultimately closing up 0.7%.
Verizon says it's negotiating a renewed carriage agreement to keep Disney's namesake network, Freeform, ESPN, and certain ABC affiliates after their current agreement expires on Dec. 31. As of Wednesday afternoon, however, Verizon says Disney had rejected each of its offers, instead ""proposing that Verizon pay hundreds of millions of dollars more for its programming, despite the fact that many of its key networks are experiencing declining viewership.""
Disney, for its part, wrote in a statement that its ""proven history of providing extraordinary value to consumers and distributors is unmatched,"" adding that it remains ""optimistic"" it will come to terms with Verizon.
Of course, Disney is also benefiting from more direct viewership lately thanks to the its ESPN+ streaming service , as well as a planned launch of a new Disney-branded streaming service next year. However, just as Verizon hopes to avoid a service disruption with these key networks, it seems safe to say Disney would rather not lose the millions of eyeballs Verizon Fios TV provides.
A word of caution on graphics chip leaders
AMD stock fell 2.3% and NVIDIA declined 1.5% in the wake of RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves tempering his bullish view of both companies.
Steves reiterated his outperform rating on both stocks, but reduced his current-quarter revenue estimates to be near the lower end of their respective guidance ranges. He also reduced his estimate for AMD's 2019 revenue to be roughly $7.29 billion (down from $7.41 billion before), and for NVIDIA's 2019 sales to be $11.76 billion (down from $11.99 billion previously).
To justify the reductions, Steves noted graphics card prices on sites like Amazon , Newegg, and eBay are declining, which could indicate a slowdown in the lucrative gaming segments for both AMD and NVIDIA.
But the analyst also admitted the price declines could be partially related to a slowdown in purchases for crypto-currency mining -- a trend that investors in both NVIDIA and AMD were already aware of .

That is because the Dec 28, 2018 $207.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
What is Implied Volatility?
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.
What do the Analysts Think?
Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Adobe Systems shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Adobe Systems is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while nine have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.87 per share to $1.63 in that period.
Given the way analysts feel about Adobe Systems right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) has done a great job transitioning into the digital payments space after being spun off from its parent, eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY ) in 2015. Whether anyone saw it at the time, the entire financial sector was about to undergo the digital and mobile transformations that we're still seeing unfold today. And PYPL stock has mostly reflected that.
While retail and other sectors incorporated the potential of digital technologies as fast as they were being developed, the financial sector - like the healthcare sector - can't move as quickly because they're highly regulated spaces.
10 Hot Companies Going Public in 2019
What that also means is, when the regulatory environments for these sectors are rapidly changing along with potential technology tools, it's even more complicated.
And that's what we've been living with as PYPL has come of age.
Big banks that had the money and bodies to incorporate new tech into their systems continue to use tech more as a tool to develop efficiencies rather than a way to improve the relationship between the institution and its customers.
Smaller institutions - local banks, credit unions, etc - don't have the money or staff to go up against the big players that are invading their markets. But they do have a better feel for their customer base's needs.
This is the gap fintech stocks have moved into, hoping to cut down the corporate red tape and aloofness, while offering faster decision-making and a variety of financial tools that smaller banks can't offer as easily.
As this massive transition began, PYPL was ready to grow and saw a market ripe for its products. And since it had built a very solid reputation as eBay's financial arm, it had a lot of good will that many newcomers didn't.
That also came in handy since PYPL wasn't just fending off newcomers. It was going toe-to-toe with the big players, like Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ).
And PYPL stock has been doing a very good job. Since its spinoff, the stock is up more than 144% in the past 3 years. Year-to-date, its up 14% and has been pretty steady for the year.
PYPL Stock Has Stayed Above the Fray in a Dramatic Market
Because consumers have stayed healthy and the economy is doing well, financials haven't been caught up in too much drama, broadly speaking.
And PYPL has become a leader in the hot new peer-to-peer payments space with its Venmo app. Creating these features aren't complicated, but if you're first to market and you establish a reliable brand, it can mean sector dominance if you play it right.
Also, PYPL has been the subject of gossip about partnering with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) as its payments provider. That would be huge.
However, it doesn't need an FB deal to make it a compelling choice. My Portfolio Grader gives it a B ranking right now, simply because the space is still wide open and PYPL is in acquisition mode.
